Good day, Dear friend

How are you doing and how are you doing? My name is Mavis Wanczyk from 
the United States of America (USA) Winner of $ 758.7 million in the 
Power Ball Lottery jackpot as the biggest prize a single fate for 
American history on August 23 In 2017 my jackpot was a turn around  for 
me .  After I received my winnings I decided to  help as much people as 
I can hence  I opened a charity organisation to help reach out to the 
less privileged and those in financial strain. My Charity Foundation has 
selected you and your family as our lucky Beneficiaries for 
$1,000,000.00 USD. Accept this offer and use for the improvement  and 
empowerment of  your family and your loved ones. For more information, 
get back to me and we shall commence from there. I want to make an 
impact in my generation.

Please you can read more about me and my Power Ball lottery Winnings via 
link below.

Hello,

I know it will be a great surprise reading from me today but consider this a divine intervention. My name is Mrs. Calista Gibson, a widow from United States of America. I am presently writing you from my sickbed because i have been fighting cancer and the doctor says i have a few weeks left.

I want to entrust my money $8.5 Million dollars to your care for charity purposes and crave your indulgence as a concerned individual to help use my money for charity and also assist the poor with less privileged in the society so reply to my private email ( mrscalistagibson2@usa.com ) for more information as I'm not always online due to my health and my late husband's brother wants me dead so that he will claim all my late husband and i worked for.

I will tell you more about myself and what you need to do with the money once your receive it. Give me your word that you will not betray my trust so that i furnish you with more details about the Charity Funds. Please reply now as my health is pretty bad, itâ€™s urgent and very important you keep this email confidential.

Have a blessed day and do not forget to pray for me.

Bless you.
Mrs. Calista Gibson."

From Mr. Allen Beneth

Administrative Service Inspection Unit
P.O. Box 20509 Atlanta, GA 30320

ATTENTION: I am Mr. Allen Beneth Head of Inspection Unit United   Nations   Inspection Agency in Harts field-Jackson International  Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered An  abandoned   shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was  transferred   from JF Kennedy Airport. To our facility here in 
Atlanta, and when  scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money  in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes  weighing approximately 242.508IBS each. The  consignment was abandoned   because the Content was not properly  declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal  Effect/classified document to  either avoid diversion by the Shipping 
Agent or confiscation by the  relevant authorities. The diplomat's  inability to pay for Non  Inspection fees among other things are the  reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. By my assessment,  each of the boxes contains  about $4M or more. They are still left in  the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like  I said  are two metal trunk boxesI need all the guarantee that I can get from  you before I can get   involved in this project. Please Reply this  email strictly at  (allenbent906@gmail.com) with reconfirmation of  your Full Name,  Home Address, City, State and Telephone number.

My Dear Friend,

I am sure this mail would be coming to you as a surprise since we have never met before and you would also be asking why I have decided to chose you amongst the numerous internet users in the world, precisely I cannot say why I have chosen you but do not be worried for I saw your profile on the Internet, which has made me accomplish my request. May the almighty God bless and see you through with this mission if you can carefully read and digest the message below.
Before I move further, permit me to give you a little of my biography, I am Mother Emilly Olivier, 87 Years old woman and the wife of Late Sir Jackman Olivier who died in a Plane crash on Monday the 7th of September 1998 GMT 14:22 UK while they were flying from New York to Geneva. Please see site below for more information. http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/ swissair.victims.list/index. html

After the death of my husband I became the Head of his investment and now that I am old and weak I have decided to spend the rest of my life with my family and loved ones whom I never had time for during the course of my business life, but before the death of my husband we had a plan to use the last days of our lives to donate half of what we have worked for to the less privilege and charity homes and the other half for ourselves, family members and close friends, and it is so unfortunate that my husband is not alive today to do this with me and I am very weak and old now, hence I have decided to do this philanthropic work on behalf of my late husband and I. Presently, I have willed out almost half of our assets to several charity homes and to some of the less privilege in different countries. Despite the agreement between my late husband and I to give aid to the deprived, we also agreed to render support to an individual we have not meet before in life due to the fact when we were still young in life.
I am sorry to inform you that you will never have the chance to know me because I have just concluded the assignment which my husband and I have agreed upon before his sudden death and you happened to be the beneficiary of our last WILL, irrespective of your previous financial status, hence I need you to do me a favor by accepting our offer that will cost you nothing.

I have presently deposited a Cheque in the sum of 5,800,000.00 British Pounds with DHL express to deliver to you, what you have to do now is to contact the DHL COURIER SERVICE as soon as possible to know when they will deliver your package to you because of the expiring date on the deposit.

I only made the deposit with your EMAIL ADDRESS and SECURITY KEEPING CODE (SCT/0433/F) because I do not know your name and the address you would want to receive the parcel with. I couldn't find them on net while browsing your profile if not I would have given it to DHL for immediate and fast delivery of this parcel to you.

For your information, I have paid for the delivering Charge, Insurance Premium and Clearance Certificate Fee of the cheque showing that it is not a Drug Money or meant to sponsor Terrorist attack in your Country.

You have to contact the DHL COURIER SERVICE now for the delivery of the cheque with this information bellow;

CONTACT PERSON:Mr. Wachter Reinbold
Email Address: dhlcourierexpres@fastservice.com
               wachtereinbold@zoho.com
Telephone: +44 1618 506766
Fax: 0044 2036086679

Again, you are not to pay for the delivering Charge, the Insurance premium and the Clearance Certificate Fee of the Cheque because I have already paid for them, the only money you are expected to pay is 135 British Pounds for the security keeping of the cheque so far.

I would have paid the fee but the company insisted that I should not because they don't know when you will be contacting them and to avoid demur-rage or further cost.

You are to reconfirm the below information to them to avoid any mistake on the Delivery.

Postal address:
Full Names:
Telephone number:

Below is the security keeping code: (SCT/0433/F) of the draft, you are to also present it to them for verification before delivery.

Let me repeat again, try to contact them as soon as you receive this mail to avoid any further delay and remember to ask them to provide you with the method they wish to use in receiving their security keeping fee of 135 British Pounds for their immediate action.
Note: Please I do not want you to thank me or my husband all I need you to do is, When you get this fund, use ONLY 800.000.00 (Eight hundred thousand British pounds) for your effort and USE THE REST OF THIS FUND FOR CHARITY PURPOSE IN THE WAY IT WILL PLEASE HUMANITY.

Yours Faithfully

DEAR Beloved,
I'm Carl Dora

PLEASE ENDEAVOR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. I am the above named person. I am married to Dr. Donald Carl A LIBERIAN but I'm now in Nigerian General HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, my husband worked with U.S embassy in LIBERIAN for nine years and also has an Engineering Company in Nigeria before he died in the year 2003, before his died in the year 2003 We were married for twenty years without a child, and i was brought up in motherless babies home in Australia before i married to him, am From Australia before i married to My husband who is from Liberia. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home because of the love both of us share.

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$8.5 Million (Eight Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this money is still under the safe keeping of the Reserve SECURITY COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next five months due to my cancer problems.

Though what disturbs me most is my stroke .Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or Muslim individual That will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church or individual that will use this fund on, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.

I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I forward your personal information, such as your full name, your full address, with telephone and fax number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your country.

I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in searching for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.

Remain blessed.

Yours in Christ,
Mrs Carl Dora "

33, helenakarppinen@protonmail.com,I seek for your urgent assistance/ cooperation.,"

Dear Beloved One,

I am writing this mail with tears and sorrow seeking your assistance due to
my medical situation here in London. I am Mrs. Helena Karppinen, citizen of
Finland and 68 years old. I was an Orphan, adopted by my late father, Engr.
Granek Karppinen, Chairman/CEO of Karppinen Oil and Gas Services. After the
death of my father, I took over his company management and also decided not
to get married since I am his only Child.

Since then, I started suffering from Coronary heart disease which has cost
me a lot and also affected every part of my body and brain cells due to
complications. Just 5 days ago, the British doctors told me that I may die
any time because my condition has gotten to a critical and life-threatening
stage. Having known my medical critical status, I therefore decided to seek
for your urgent assistance/ cooperation to use my inheritance $18.3 Million
USD, to Build Orphanage homes in memory of me when am gone.

I took this bold decision because I do not have husband, family or children
that can inherit these funds when am gone. If interested, you shall take
25% out of the total money for your assistance, and also use the balance to
build Orphanage homes in memory of me. I interested, get back to me
urgently for more details and to proceed. Immediately I hearing from you I
shall issue you Certificate of Deposit and my father death certificate for
your confirmation before we proceed, to establish you as my legal
beneficiary in receiving the money on my behalf.

I am waiting to hearing from you urgently.

Yours Sincerely,
Mrs. Helena Karppinen.

From Mr. Allen Beneth

Administrative Service Inspection Unit
P.O. Box 20509 Atlanta, GA 30320

ATTENTION: I am Mr. Allen Beneth Head of Inspection Unit United   Nations   Inspection Agency in Harts field-Jackson International  Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered An  abandoned   shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was  transferred   from JF Kennedy Airport. To our facility here in 
Atlanta, and when  scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money  in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes  weighing approximately 242.508IBS each. The  consignment was abandoned   because the Content was not properly  declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal  Effect/classified document to  either avoid diversion by the Shipping 
Agent or confiscation by the  relevant authorities. The diplomat's  inability to pay for Non  Inspection fees among other things are the  reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. By my assessment,  each of the boxes contains  about $4M or more. They are still left in  the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like  I said  are two metal trunk boxesI need all the guarantee that I can get from  you before I can get   involved in this project. Please Reply this  email strictly at  (allenbent906@gmail.com) with reconfirmation of  your Full Name,  Home Address, City, State and Telephone number.

DEAR Beloved,
I'm Carl Dora

PLEASE ENDEAVOR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. I am the above named person. I am married to Dr. Donald Carl A LIBERIAN but I'm now in Nigerian General HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, my husband worked with U.S embassy in LIBERIAN for nine years and also has an Engineering Company in Nigeria before he died in the year 2003, before his died in the year 2003 We were married for twenty years without a child, and i was brought up in motherless babies home in Australia before i married to him, am From Australia before i married to My husband who is from Liberia. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home because of the love both of us share.

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$8.5 Million (Eight Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this money is still under the safe keeping of the Reserve SECURITY COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next five months due to my cancer problems.

Though what disturbs me most is my stroke .Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or Muslim individual That will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church or individual that will use this fund on, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.

I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I forward your personal information, such as your full name, your full address, with telephone and fax number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your country.

I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in searching for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.

Remain blessed.

Please read this mail carefully and proceed to collect your ATM
CARD worth US$4.500,000.00 payment.
Following the last year review of the global financial matters
and just concluded investigations today by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in conjunction with  the ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
CRIME COMMISSION (E.F.C.C), it is revealed that your email is
among the list of people who have never received any of their
payments among  lottery, inheritance, compensation and awarded
contract funds and victims who have lost a lot of money to
scammers while trying to claim their funds.

In view of the foregoing, a new payment of US$4.500,000.00 has
been approved in your favor and credited into an ATM CARD which
shall be delivered to you.

scamming most foreigner creditors that we have in the payment 
list
here in our office. We use this medium to inform you that
any mail that does not come with the new communication code:
NG/.CCUF -HFCR-/RLPHJ/.is false. In this case, youâ€™re advised not
to respond to any mail that does not come with the above
communication code for safety purpose.

an automated teller machine card (ATM) as it seems, this will be
easier and faster for you to receive payment.

Good day dear!



I am Federica Scondanibbio, Attorney at law. A deceased client of mine,
that shares the same last name as yours, who died as the result of a
heart-related condition in March 12th 2009. His heart condition was due to
the death of all the members of his family in the plan crash in January
10th 2009.



I have contacted you to assist in distributing the money left behind by my
client before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank
where this deposit valued at Forty Eight Million US Dollars
($48,000,000.00) is lodged. This bank has issued me a notice to contact
the next of kin, or the account will be confiscated.



My proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as the
next-of-kin and beneficiary of my named client, since you have the same
last name, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. Then
we can share the amount on a mutually agreed-upon percentage. All legal
documents to back up your claim as my client's next-of-kin will be
provided. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this
transaction through.




This will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you
from many breach of the law. If this business proposition offends your
moral values, do accept my apology. I must use this opportunity to implore
you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinary
confidential, whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.
Please contact me at once to indicate your interest. I will like you to
acknowledge the receipt of this e-mail as soon as possible via my private
EMAIL :(drfedericascondanibbio@gmail.com) and treat with absolute
confidentiality and sincerity.




I look forward to your quick reply.
Best regards,
Federica Scondanibbio (Esq)

78, angelagri2018@gmail.com,JUBILEE NEW YEAR OF MERCY.,"

Hello dear!,

Happy new year to you and family as we have waved a goodbye to the old year &amp; embrace the new year with full of hope, dream and ambition. 

I am Angela, it is so sad to write you about my late daddy's mysteriously death during his business trip, at first. My daddy of blessed memory by name late Griffith Walsh. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by cardiac arrest, unexpected loss of heart function in Burkina Faso on (16 June 2018) during his business trip of gold in Burkina Faso and are left with ($8,500,000.00) on his offshore account there.

God's Justice creates an opportunity to receive and make room for newness to happen in our midst. To be just in the eyes of God is to be fair. 

My father used my name as his next of kin and the inheritor to the money before his death, and he left a WILL with the bank that restrained me from accessing the money here unless I got married or found someone from overseas who will help me and invest the money wisely. As a university undergraduate and really dont know what to do.

The code of his Will forbids me to acquire such amount of money without been married or found someone from overseas who will help me invest the money wisely. He made the deposit as a fund belonging to his business in order not to raise eyebrow.

It is on this basis that I am contacting you for assisting me to receive the money, I located the bank, and have also discussed the possible transfer of the fund. I forced myself to contact the bank, but the bank response was that I should look for someone to help me secure the money as instructed by my late father. I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of my late father's tragic death. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Whether you can honestly help me as you would do to your own child?. While I continue with my education I will like to invest this money into lucrative business but I need you to put me through.

Please I am now seeking for your assistance to help me receive this money in your account abroad so that you can invest it in any meaningful and lucrative business of your choice because this is my only hope in life. I am willing to offer you 30% of the total fund if only you can help me out of my present predicament.

Dear Friend,

I'm sorry but happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from Vietnam, though I tried my best to involve you in the business but God decided the whole situations. Presently I m in Vietnam for investment projects with my own share of the total sum. Meanwhile, I didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how.

Now contact my secretary in Burkina Faso her name is Ms. Safiatou Matter on her e-mail address below (safi.matter025@yahoo.com) ask her to send you the total of $450,000.00 which I kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much. So feel free and get in touched with my secretary Ms. Safiatou Matter and instruct her where to send the amount to you. Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the joy after all the sufferer at that time.

In the moment, I m very busy here because of the investment projects which I and the new partner are having at hand, finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to the secretary on your behalf to receive that money, so feel free to get in touch with Ms. Safiatou Matter she will send the amount to you without any delay OK. Extend my greetings to your family.

My Best regards

Dear Beloved,


Please read this slowly and carefully, as it may be one of the most
important emails you ever get. I am Mrs Naomi Patterson , I was married to
Late Mr. Jon Patterson . He used to work with Shell Petroleum Development
Company Kuwait and was also a seasoned contractor in the Middle East
Region. He died on 31 December, 2010 in Italy.


We were married for seventeen years without a child. After his death I
decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home. When
my late husband was alive, he deposited the sum of $15,000,000.00USD in
a bank . My Doctor told me that I would not last long due to my
complicated health issues, I have cancer. Having known my condition I
decided to donate these funds to better the lives of the less privileged
need an honest and trustworthy individual that will utilize this money
in accordance with my instruction.


I want the funds to be used in funding religious organizations,
orphanages and the less privileged propagating the word of God. I took
this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this
money and my husband's relatives are very unkind to me and I don't want
my husband's hard earned money to be misused. I am not afraid of death
hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom
of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my course and
I shall hold my peace. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you
the contact of the Bank, and my Attorney.


For legitimacy, he will also issue you a Letter of Authorization that
will empower you as the original-beneficiary of this fund. I want you to
always pray for me, Any delay in your reply will give me room in
sourcing for another individual for this same purpose, if you are not
interested, kindly pardon me for contacting you.

Yours Faithfully,

Mrs Naomi Patterson"
96, Ibrahimm02@mail.com,Final Notice,"

Sometimes, I do wonder if you are really, really with your senses. 

How Could you keep trusting people and at the end you will loose 

your hard Earned money, or are you being deceived by their big 

names  They Impersonate on many offices, claiming to be Governors, 

Directors/Chairmen of one Office or the other. Their game plan is 

only just to extort your hard Earned money. Now, the question is how 

long you will continue to be Deceived  Sometimes, they will issue 

you fake check, introduce you to fake Diplomatic delivery, un-

existing on-line banking and they will also fake wire transfer of 

Your fund with Payment Stop Order and even send you fake Atm cards 

etc. Anyway, by the virtue of my position I have been following this 

Transaction from inception and all your efforts towards realizing 

the Fund. More often than not, I sit down and laugh at your 

ignorance andThat of those who claim they are assisting you, it is 

very unfortunate That at the end you loose. Although, I don't blame 

you because you are Not here in Nigeria to witness the processing of 

your payment in Nigeria. The problem you are having is that you been 

told the whole truth About this transaction and it is because of 

this truth they decided to Be extorting your money. The most 

annoying part is even fraudsters Have really taken advantage of this 

opportunity to enrich them selves At your expense. Those you feel 

are assisting or working for you are Your main problems. I know the 

truth surrounding this payment and I am The only person who will 

deliver you from this long suffering if you will abide by my advice.

They claim that they are helping you and you forward all the 

fraudulent e-mails you receive to them. At the end they do nothing 

about the fraudsters. Soon they will ask you to pay money to receive 

a compensation of millions of dollars Do not pay any money to them 

because they are only interested in your hard earned money and you
will never receive any compensation in return, they will always keep 

coming back to ask for more money. Please I beseech you to stop 

pursuit of shadows and being Deceived.Feel free to contact me 

immediately you receive this mail so that I can Explain to you the 

modus-operandi guiding the release of your Payment. Do not panic, be 

rest assured that this arrangement will be Guided by your Embassy 

here in Nigeria.

N/B: You are urgently requested to provide me with the following 

information

Full Name:
Address:
Telephone Number:
Passport Or National Identity Copy:

Contact me upon the receipt of this mail if you wish to receive your

Dear Respectfully,

In my long years of work with top financial management companies in the United Kingdom, l and my Partner Mr. Hernandez have earned the confidence of most our high net-worth clients. I presently have two clients (Non Europeans) who have funds to give out for investment either on equity or loan basis.

The areas to be considered for the investment are as follows Real estate, Oil &amp; Gas, Agriculture, Health, Aviation, Tourism, Retail, Construction, IT &amp; Communications, Technology, Education, Energy, Engineering, Utilities, Telecoms, Mining, Maritime, sustainable energy and host of other profitable ventures.

Intending beneficiaries must have a business plan and show their capability to manage huge funds. The beneficiary must be able to deliver good and sustainable returns on investment to the investor annually. If you are that person or establishment seeking to expand your existing business or you have new ideas waiting for implementation, the opportunity is here.

Hello Sir/Madam,

I am a private investor based in Europe (Utrecht). A group of government officials from South Africa contacted me with an offer. I am to solicit and state their offer, if your interest is genuine,you can contact me for further briefing.

You will be made a beneficiary of a very huge sum of money($200M) and it will be transferred to you. A high compensation of 20% awaits you, the remaining balance (minus the interest, handling and tax clearance charges, which will be offset by us and deducted from the transfer sum) to a nominated bank account in Europe or your country.

I donâ€™t think I need to spell out the importance of secrecy in this matter considering what is involved. Let me state clearly here that the account you will be providing does not need to have funds in it; it is only needed to be active and be able to receive the funds in question.

I need your quick response to this mail to indicate your intent, by forwarding your details to me. This is important as we would need to talk and have a meeting to discuss the modalities of this offer. For further clarification please contact me through my private email address: invbrics@gmail.com

Yours sincerely,

-- 
My name is Barr. Jose Pedro Perez-Llorca, a legal practitioner in Madrid 
Spain. I have a business proposal which i believe that will be a very 
good opportunity for both of us so I decided to contact you on this 
business opportunity here in Spain.

The proposal is that I have a client, who was deceased since 2000, 
alongside with his entire family in Air France,you can confirm it 
yourself via the website below from (BBC NEWS: click on the link below 
for more prove, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/859479.stm.
I am contacting you to know if you could help or assist me in claiming 
of the funds that was left in my deceased client's bank account in 
Spain. So, I have decided to make this business proposal to you and 
release the money to you as the next of kin to the deceased since nobody 
is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into the banks 
treasury as unclaimed funds or declared to the Government of Spain, once 
this is done the Government of Spain will confiscate the funds, which is 
not good for both of us. I agreed that 40 % of this money will be for 
you as a foreign partner, in respect to your acceptance to do this 
business with me, while 60% would be for me and my family. The total 
amount of cash in the bank account of my deceased client is 
EUR24,700,000 (Twenty Four Million, Seven Hundred Thousand Euros Only).

The bank have issued to me a notification to contact the next of kin of 
my deceased client for either to re-activate the bank account or to make 
claim of beneficiary of the Money in the bank account, with a month 
surcharge of 6% to be deducted as an Escrow safe keeping fee of the bank 
account, so as to avoid the indefinite closure of the bank account. I 
want to seek your consent first and to present your kind self as the 
next of kin and beneficiary of my deceased client, since I have the 
whole information's that the bank will request for the release of the 
fund.
This means that the proceeds of his bank account would be paid to you as 
his next of kin or the legitimate beneficiary. When the money is been 
transferred into your account, I will visit your country to set up an 
investment under your kind control. All the legal documents to back up 
your claim as my client's next of kin would be provided by me. The most 
important thing I want is your honest co-operation in this proposition. 
This would be done under a legitimate arrangement that would protect you 
from any breach of the law.

If this business proposition offends your moral and ethical values, feel 
free to back out. Please contact me at once if you are interested.


Regards,

Barr. Jose Pedro Perez-Llorca

Dear Friend.

A customer of ours who died (13) years ago in Tsunami tragedy in Indonesia leaving behind an estate/capital (US$20M) in a Bank here where I work, till date nobody has come forward or put application for the claim. During the Bank private search for the late gentle man relatives your name and email contact was among the findings that matches the same surname as the deceased who died intestate with no Will or next of kin. To maintain the level of security required I have intentionally left out the final details. Banking regulation/legislation demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory time period when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory bodies if nobody applies to claim the funds. I urge you to come forward since I can provide you with the details needed for you to claim the estate/capital so that I can be gratify by you ,in this way $12,000,000.00 for you and $8,000,000.00 for me. I will do all the crucial part in the Bank to have the claim released to you promptly. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue to affirm your willingness and cooperation please do so by replying me with your Telephone Number and Your Contact Information. I do expect your prompt response.

Good Day to you,

This letter should have reached you by post because of its highly
confidential nature but in these days of internet speed and issues,
this seems to be the most, take-a-chance, direct means of contact. I
crave your discreet indulgence herein should you be inclined towards
this brief.

I am one of the members of the Special Committee for Budget and
Planning at the Ministry of Petroleum. This committee is principally
for Federal Government contract appraisals and approval in order of
priorities as regards capital projects in Nigeria.

With my position, I have successfully secured the sum of Twenty Seven
million, Five hundred thousand dollars (US$27.5M). This amount was
accumulated from assumed mark-up on any disbursed invoice, for example
NOSDRA (National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency) account for
2015 is USD 349,978,185,874.21 and NIMASA (Nigerian Maritime
Administration and Safety Agency) 2014 spill-over account is USD580,
986,085,732.98. Hence after $350 billion is drawn and exhausted, the
mumbo-jumbo of how 978,185,874.21 checks out is my business. Together
with some of top officials of The Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation and the Federal Ministry of Finance, we found that these
withdrawals were previously not accounted for nor were these excesses
ever balanced since inception of crude oil accountancy in the
NNPC/Federal Ministry of Finance in Nigeria.

I plan to transfer this amount accumulated overtime, into an overseas
account via our Federal Ministry of Finance, by awarding you an
already existent and paid off contract from my ministry (NNPC). To
this effect, I decided to contact you and ask for your assistance.
What I need from you is to provide an existing account and your vital
identification to stand as this contract executor.

We have concluded to compensate the owner of the account for this
transaction with 45% of the total amount remitted. We shall keep 50%
and remaining 5% reserved for taxes. Finally, the confidence and trust
reposed on you cannot be over emphasized judging from the caliber of
personnel involved.

Please consider within yourself to come in with us or not, with the
unequivocal promise not to jeopardize each other in any way. I
represent my senior colleagues without fear, having taken meticulous
time to perfect the sequence of government protocol and transfer. This
contact to you is hereby left to fate that we pray to encounter a
reasonable business-minded individual. Do kindly contact me urgently
for our easier communication.

Yours sincerely

Re: Urgent Notice.

The recent launched Joint External Debt Hub (JEDH) by the Inter-Agency
Task Force on Finance Statistics (TFFS) This joint launch is by the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS), International Monetary Fund
(IMF), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),
and the World Bank and represents efforts to synergize international
advances in the area of external debt statistics. Due to this new
organization, the World Bank has gratified the international Debt
Management to look into the all outstanding contractors/Workers due
for payment with US Government.

In Regards to this, your name was among the unsettled
contractors/Workers who have not received their payments. I wish to
inform you that the international Debt Management has been approved
and instructed by world debt organization &amp; World Bank to process and
release all the outstanding payment which has been
due for payment.

This is to officially notify you that the World Bank in conjunction
with the United States set aside US$3.4Billion to pay in good claims
from foreign Inheritance Fund (Next of Kin); In line with this
arrangement the United States on Foreign Debt Matters (USFDM) ordered
that contractors and Next-of-Kins whose file have shown sufficient
proof regarding job execution and debt outstanding be settled without
delay.

We wish to inform you that your file was forwarded to First Citizens
Bank by various offices and department showing that you have fulfilled
all conditions necessary to receive your payment.


One of the reasons your payment had been delayed for so long was
because of counter-claim on your fund, this necessitated the perusal
of documents relating to your contract payment, we were convinced that
you are the bona-fide beneficiary to the said fund. The attempts to
divert your payment to foreign account was done by your local
representatives in collaboration with some Officials and most of the
officials involved in several executive misconducts have been sacked.

I hereby inform you this day that your inheritance sum calculated
US$10.5M shall be paid to you via online Wire Transfer due to
rules/regulation guiding Bank Secrecy Act(BSA). Be aware that all
necessary modalities concerning the release of your fund have
regularized, so all we require from you is your honest concentration
to make this transfer happen within 72hrs. Kindly contact us in our
Customer Care Email: customercare@firstctizens.us


Get back to us as to enable us proceed.

Apt 303, New Braunfels Texas, United States, am thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Istanbul Turkey many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $20,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to no avail.

So I decided to travel down to Istanbul Turkey with all my compensation documents, And I was directed to meet Mr Alex Staurts , who is the member of COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE, and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake.

He took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $4,500,000.00 Moreover, Mr Alex Staurts, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name as one of the beneficiaries, and your email address, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact Mr Stilwell Mattias.You have to contact him directly on this information below.

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.

The only money I paid after I met Mr Stilwell Mattias was just $550 for the paper works, take note of that.Once again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact Mr Stilwell Mattias so that he can help you to Transfer your Fund into your account, instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Compliments of the day, I am contacting you for a mutual beneficial  
business with believe you will not betray me at the end. I am  
Dr.Harris Thompson; Statistics Admin Manager, 2 Gresham Street, London  
EC2V 7QP Investec Bank plc, here in England. During the recent  
audition of bank accounts and services of our bank; I discovered a  
non-resident bank account which have not been operated for a long  
time. After a discrete inquiry, I found out that the owner of this  
account was a United States citizen  Mr. David Anderson, a business  
man who died with his family in Atlasjet Flight 4203 crash On November  
30, 2007. Until now, nobody knows about his bank account with Investec  
Bank. This account holds (17,500,000.00 GBP) Seventeen Million Five  
Hundred Thousand Great British Pounds Sterling only.

I contact you as a foreigner; in order to arrange with you for the  
transfer of this money out from the account, before our next audition  
of bank accounts because If the bank management find out that this  
account has been latent for these long, it will be frozen and the  
money will be returned to the bank treasury, as unclaimed public  
funds. Therefore I want you to stand as the ""Foreign Beneficiary"". I  
need your full co-operation to make this transaction work out  
perfectly because the bank management is ready to approve the  
immediate payment to whoever that would be presented as the

Good day,
 
I am Ms Carolyn Smith, a US citizen, Am 31 years old. I am one of those people that took part in receiving Inheritance funds and Lottery funds/Consignment box,ATM compensation card, Bank check from European banks even from many lottery organizers few years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid different fees while in the United States trying to get my funds from those banks and lottery organizers but all to no avail. So I decided to travel to Nigeria with all my compensation documents, and I was directed by the IMF Director to contact the reconciliator Attorney Alfred Morris who is an attorney, A Bristish citizen and a member of the UNITED NATIONS &amp; IMF COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE currently working with IMF in the Nigeria and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake. Attorney Richard Edward personally directed me on how to claim my Inheritance or Lottery payment.
 
Right now I have received my compensation funds of $1,500,000.00 Moreover, Attorney Richard Edward, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their Inheritance or Lottery payment and I saw your name as one of the beneficiaries, and your email address, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you.
 
I will personally advise you to contact Attorney Richard Edward, he will assist you as he is a very religious man with the fear of God.
 
Compensation Award Office.
 
Name: Attorney Sir Richard Edward
Email: scamvictim2002@gmail.com
 
Listed below are the name of fraudsters and banks behind the non release of your funds that I managed to sneak out for your kind perusal.

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing. The only money I paid after I met Attorney Richard Edward was just $125 for the Endorsement Fee, take note of that.
Thank You and Be Blessed.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
OFFICE OF THE PAYMENT VERIFICATION PANEL
LAGOS LIAISON OFFICE
DATE: 08/01/2019

ATTENTION DEAR BENEFICIARY,


YOUR OUTSTANDING PAYMENT.


We hereby bring to your notice that your outstanding payment with the
Federal Government of Nigeria has reached this office for verification
and clarifications before the release. Anyway, without wasting much
time,I have personally investigated this payment down to the Ministry
were this contract was executed and from my findings it is clear that
you did not execute this contract in question, from all available
information, it looks like some officials in the Ministry were trying
to use you to claim this particular value which they over invoiced for
their own selfish interest. I know it might interest you to know how I
managed to find out this truth, yes. I investigated this payment up to
the ministry were this contract was executed and after some checks I
was surprise to see that the most vital/important documents regarding
to this contract bears a different name and beneficiary.

Based on this I decide to contact the supervisor that signed the
attestation report, on getting to the contract award and supervisory
commission I collected the contract attestation report and found out
that this document steel bears the name: B&amp; B PETROLEUM ENG.PTY as the
company that executed this contract. I keep this to my self and came
down to my base. As a matter of fact I have been thinking whether to
report my findings to the appropriate body for cancellation of this
payment, but I have this second thought of contacting you since I am
not a saint and in a position to approve this payment for the
president to give go ahead order to the release, I feel this might be
a Gods given opportunity.


So it is based on this I am writing you, if you will accept with my
understated conditions I can normalize all the relevant papers of this
payment and the funds will be release within 14 working days. Contract
attestation report is not in your name, the fund owner ship
certificate is also not in your name. Actually your partners as I
should say did a very great work in manipulating almost all the
documents to your favor.


Now, I want you to know that, with my position, I can amend this
problems and this money will be paid to your nominated bank account
which both of us will share on a 50/50 %if only you will accept with
my conditions.


So, if you see it wise to get this perfected with me feel free to
contact me through my private email address (
tonyebererepanel@gmail.com )


I shall let you know my conditions as soon as I here from you.


Thanks,

187, MRSKATHLEEN2017@gmail.com,Dear Sir,"

Attention Sir/Madam,

Firstly, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is
by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well
at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you due to the
urgency of this transaction, as we have been reliably informed of it's
swiftness and confidentiality.

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am Mr
Collins Mark, a Manager at the Unity Trust bank, Benin Republic. I
came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable
person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the
transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum
confidence.

A foreigner, Late ship Captain Steve D. Lawrence ,an oil Merchant
/contractor with the federal Government of Benin Republic ,until his
death Five years ago in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at
the Unity Trust Bank, Benin Republic, and had a closing balance of
US$20.5M (Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)
which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his
available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a
discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war
college here in Benin Republic.

Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Unity Trust Bank to get
in touch with any of late Captain Steve D. Lawrence's next of kin (he
had no known wife and children) that the management under the
influence of our chairman, board of directors, Retired Major General
Joseph Gabba, that an arrangement for the fund to be declared
""UNCLAIMED "" and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund or an
orphanage Home.

In order to avert this negative development , myself and some of my
trusted colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have
you stand as late Captain Steve D. Lawrence's next of kin so that the
fund,US$20.5M, would be subsequently transferred and paid into your
bank account as the beneficiary next of kin. All documents and proves
to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and we are
assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 40% of
the total amount. 10% has been set aside for expenses, while the rest
50% would be for me and my colleagues for our involvement and we wish
to invest our shares in real estate /oil business in your country.

If this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to take advantage of
the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get
to me immediately via my  e-mail furnishing me with your most
confidential telephone, contact address and  e-mail and national
identification card, so that i can forward to you the relevant details
of this transaction. Thank you in advance for your anticipated
co-operation.

MR.SMITH JOHNSON OF
FIRST BANK OF NIGERIA
35 Marina P. O. Box 5216,
LAGOS- NIGERIA
EMAIL: firstbnig@protonmail.com

DEAR BENEFICIARY

This letter is written to you in order to change your life from today.
I am Mr.Smith Johnson the Director, International Remittance
Department of this Bank, my Boss, Mr. Herbert Wigwe, the Managing
Director/CEO of this bank is now on compulsory leave and all power
have been vested on me to make all international payments. Also, due
to reported cases of corrupt practices in other Nigeria Banks
including the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Federal Government has
revoked/cancelled all power vested on those banks and has appointed
our bank (FIRST BANK NIGERIA PLC) to make all foreign payments. Be
informed that the Federal Government have approved the release of
part-payment of$10.5M(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) out
of your total funds, which has been in this bank for many years
unclaimed because my boss Mr. Herbert Wigwe, elaboration with the
Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) have refused to tell you the
truth on how to claim your fund this is because he has been using the
interest accumulated from your fund every year to enrich himself
without your knowledge, I want to help you pull out this fund to your
bank account using the easiest and the quickest method, which have not
been made known to you before. By this method, you will open a
domiciliary account with this bank (FIRST BANK NIGERIA PLC), your fund
would be lodged into this domiciliary account and your fund will be
paid in directly to any bank of your choice.

After the transfer, you will confirm the fund in your bank account
within 5hours the same day. No Cost of Transfer (COT) and no stoppage
from any Government departments as the transfer will be done within
the bank alone and it is very safe. The method which was introduced to
you before is the Telegraphic Transfer (TT) for which confirmation was
48hrs, because of the time factor, petitions could come from various
organizations stopping your payment and asking you to pay huge fee
which would be difficult for you to pay so that they can benefit from
the huge interest your fund generates while still in the Bank.
This method is not safe for you because it is not done within the bank
alone as information of the payment would be sent to the Central
Control Unit (CCU) of the Federal Ministry of Finance and office of
the Accountant General of the Federation. As a good Christian, I have
nothing to gain by keeping your fund, I want to assist you receive
your fund before my boss resumes office. You have to follow up and
work with me now, so keep this very confidential because of fraudsters
and impostors who go about presenting various bank accounts in order
to divert another beneficiary's fund. Your present/valid account
co-ordinates and amount to be claimed so that I do not transfer your
fund to the wrong Bank Account.

Await your quick Reply to via private id (firstbnig@protonmail.com

Mr.Smith Johnson"

Attn: My Dear,


I am Mrs. Nidia Marisela Juarez Bustamante,Am a single mother of two, am a US citizen, I reside here in Harlingen Texas. My residential address is as follows. 7901 W BUSINESS 83 LOT #1 HARLINGEN TEXAS 78552-0000, United States. am thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Cotonou, Benin Republic many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over US$35,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to no avail. So I decided to keep trusting God for a miracle because Almighty God never fails. One faithful morning, i received an email  from Lasayeth Young of which he told me that he  is the member of VALLEY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION &amp; also a member of the COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE in Alabama, USA, and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake from Africa are all fake.

He helped  me to claim  my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $3.5 Million US Dollars Moreover, Barrister Lasayeth Young, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email address as one of the beneficiaries, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact Barrister Lasayeth Young.

You have to contact her directly on this information below.

COMPENSATION AWARD HOUSE

Name : Barrister Lasayeth Young

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing. The only money I paid after I met Barrister Lasayeth Young was just US$350 for the paper works, take note of that. As soon as you contact him he will send you the payment information which you are to use in sending the payment to him in order for him to obtain the documents from the court of law there in Alabama so that your fund can be transfer to you without any delay just the way mine was being transfer to me.

Send him the following details if you know you are ready to have your FUNDS so that as soon as he receive your information he will send to you the payment details for sending him the $350 USD that is needed for him to get the document that is needed to make the transfer a successful one and that is that only payment i made to Barrister Lasayeth Young and he helped me in the transferring of my FUNDS and i must say that you have to contact him so that he will help you the way he helped me to Get my FUNDS without any further payment.

Fill out the information to him if you are ready to get your FUNDS

Country.................
Occupation:.....................
Gender:.........

Once again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact Barrister Lasayeth Young so that he can help you to Deliver your fund instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank You and Be Blessed.

PAYMENT NOTIFICATION OF YOUR FUND.

Please read this mail carefully and proceed to collect your ATM
CARD worth US$4.500,000.00 payment.
Following the last year review of the global financial matters
and just concluded investigations today by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in conjunction with  the ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
CRIME COMMISSION (E.F.C.C), it is revealed that your email is
among the list of people who have never received any of their
payments among  lottery, inheritance, compensation and awarded
contract funds and victims who have lost a lot of money to
scammers while trying to claim their funds.

In view of the foregoing, a new payment of US$4.500,000.00 has
been approved in your favor and credited into an ATM CARD which
shall be delivered to you.
Note: Thousands of fraudsters have been using this method in 
scamming most foreigner creditors that we have in the payment list
here in our office. We use this medium to inform you that
any mail that does not come with the new communication code:
NG/.CCUF -HFCR-/RLPHJ/.is false. In this case, youâ€™re advised not

Our final conclusion was that the fund should be paid to you via
an automated teller machine card (ATM) as it seems, this will be
easier and faster for you to receive payment.

the below details for proper verification and documentation also

205, upsdelivery644@gmail.com,CONTACT UPS COMPANY FOR YOUR ATTM CARD OF $18.9MILLION NOW,"

Dear.Beneficiary,

This is to bring to your notice that because of the impossibility of
your fund transfer through the Money Gram network, we have credited
your total of $18.9MILLON, valid fund into an ATM MASTER CARD and I have
paid the re-activation fee and the delivery of the ATM Card To you,

I paid it because the ATM Card worth of $18.9MILLON, which I have
registered it delivery yesterday has less than 21 days to expire in
the custody of the UPS Company and when it expires, the money will go
into Federal Government treasury account. With that we decided to help
you pay off the money so that the ATM Card will not expire, because I
trust that when you receive your ATM Card definitely you must pay me
back my money and even compensate me for helping you.

Now I want you to contact UPS Express at: upsdelivery644@gmail.com
with your physical address you desire the delivery to be made so that
they can deliver your ATM Card to your designated address without any
delay.

Like I stated earlier, the crediting re-activation, delivery and the
company registration charges has been paid by me, but we did not pay
their official keeping fees since they refused, they refused and the
reason is that they do not know when you are going to contact them and
the demur-rage might have increased by then, They told me that their
keeping fees is $35 per day only, and I deposited it yesterday on 2th
of JANU 2019

Below is the Contact Information of the
UPS, Express Customer Service
Director Mr. GRRRY MILLIS
Email Address; upsdelivery644@gmail.com
Phone unmber +2348122865449

Contact them today and also send them the security official keeping
charge to avoid increase of their fees and let me know once you
receive your ATM card, Important Notice, your ATM CARD package was
registered as a gift so that the diplomatic Agent will not know the
content of your package okay.

We are a european company in the process of shutting down our

 been given a mandate by the other directors to replace one of our

 We stopped negotiations with a prospective investor who wanted us
 to use all our funds to buy wine farms and also wanted more than
 20% of the profits and this is not the 14% we agreed to initially
 and we prefer a diversified investment portfolio.

 We have a portfolio dedicated for growth even in areas outside of

Interim Head of Luggage/Baggage
(Operations,Maintenance,Transp ortation)
Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport
Address: 6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Atlanta, GA 30320, USA



Attention: Please

                                Re: Your Abandoned Package For Delivery

I have very vital information to give to you, but first I must have your trust before I review it to you because it may cause me my job, so I need somebody that I can trust for me to be able to review the secret to you.

I am David E.Jordan, Head of luggage/baggage storage facilities (Operations) here at Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport USA, During my recent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from Africa and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 110kg.

The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as â€œMONEYâ€ rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is $3,700USD. On my assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage Vault here at the Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport till date,the details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the  Trunk box.

However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment, as the Interim Head of Luggage/Baggage Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents tagged.

Note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department OR to its country of origin as unclaimed delivery,I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address for quick processing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything concluded within 48hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.

Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to transact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment have not yet been return to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share.

I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential.

Please get back to me via my private Email  (  davidjordan18@yahoo.com) for further directives:

You can call me on my telephone number and drop a message.


Thank you.

Good Day,
My name is Mrs. Irene Shawcross; I am a dying woman who had decided to
donate what I have to the Charities based on the instructions given to 
me by my late husband Mr. Shaw. I am 70 years old and was diagnosed with 
cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death of my husband 
who was Marine engineer and a contractor from governmental tenders and 
other private entities, my late husband died accidentally under one of 
the heavy duty equipment at one of his construction sites, We had not a 
single child of our own to count on, We have been touched to donate from 
what I have inherited from my late husband for the good work rather than 
allow his relatives to varnish my husband's hard earned fund, although 
they have already looted and taken a lot. My health will not permit me 
to carry out some of the things, each day that passes by, I am afraid to 
die, but life gives me no choice, but to answer the call.

I managed to get your contact details online in my desperate search for 
a trustworthy person to assist me in this transaction, and he or she  
will also benefit financially. Recently, the doctors told me I might not 
live longer than 3 months after they diagnosed me of chronic/acute 
lymphoma or myelitis [leukemia]. Leukemia is a blood cancer in both the 
bone marrow and in blood itself, leukemia cells crowd out normal blood 
cells leading to serious bleeding and infection. I have been undergoing 
blood transfusion and it has drained My purse and little savings in my 
hand although I belong to the high and rich, but feed like a person who 
has nothing, as a result of this sickness. I want you to help me in 
carrying out my last wish on earth which will be very profitable to us. 
I want to WILL/Donate to you the total sum of $30.5 million USDollars 
(Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) to you which I want 
you to distribute part of it to any charity home for me in your country 
and the rest for yourself and your family which I will inform you on how 
to share all as part of instructions from my late husband before his 
death; You will get 20% of the fund as your compensation for helping me 
and my late husband to fulfill the project.
please for further information contact me ASAP. Please reply as quickly 
as you can, based on the fact that this is very urgent. You can also 
call me if you can, although I am in and out the hospital for treatment, 
but once the hospital gives me chance to use my phone I will answer your 
call.
Here is my Direct email address (  irshawcross@gmail.com  ) .
Phone: No  +27-79-4405094

Hello Sir/Madam,

I am a private investor based in Europe (Utrecht). A group of government officials from South Africa contacted me with an offer. I am to solicit and state their offer, if your interest is genuine,you can contact me for further briefing.

You will be made a beneficiary of a very huge sum of money($200M) and it will be transferred to you. A high compensation of 20% awaits you, the remaining balance (minus the interest, handling and tax clearance charges, which will be offset by us and deducted from the transfer sum) to a nominated bank account in Europe or your country.

I donâ€™t think I need to spell out the importance of secrecy in this matter considering what is involved. Let me state clearly here that the account you will be providing does not need to have funds in it; it is only needed to be active and be able to receive the funds in question.

I need your quick response to this mail to indicate your intent, by forwarding your details to me. This is important as we would need to talk and have a meeting to discuss the modalities of this offer.

Hey!  Hello there!,

Happy new year to you and family as we have waved a goodbye to the old year &amp; embrace the new year with full of hope, dream and ambition. 

I am Angela, it is so sad to write you about my late daddy's mysteriously death during his business trip, at first. My daddy of blessed memory by name late Griffith Walsh. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by cardiac arrest, unexpected loss of heart function in Burkina Faso on (16 June 2018) during his business trip of gold in Burkina Faso and are left with ($8,500,000.00) on his offshore account there.

God's Justice creates an opportunity to receive and make room for newness to happen in our midst. To be just in the eyes of God is to be fair. 

My father used my name as his next of kin and the inheritor to the money before his death, and he left a WILL with the bank that restrained me from accessing the money here unless I got married or found someone from overseas who will help me and invest the money wisely. As a university undergraduate and really dont know what to do.

The code of his Will forbids me to acquire such amount of money without been married or found someone from overseas who will help me invest the money wisely. He made the deposit as a fund belonging to his business in order not to raise eyebrow.

It is on this basis that I am contacting you for assisting me to receive the money, I located the bank, and have also discussed the possible transfer of the fund. I forced myself to contact the bank, but the bank response was that I should look for someone to help me secure the money as instructed by my late father. I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of my late father's tragic death. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Whether you can honestly help me as you would do to your own child?. While I continue with my education I will like to invest this money into lucrative business but I need you to put me through.

Please I am now seeking for your assistance to help me receive this money in your account abroad so that you can invest it in any meaningful and lucrative business of your choice because this is my only hope in life. I am willing to offer you 30% of the total fund if only you can help me out of my present predicament.

243, mrskarenwoodlock1@onet.eu,Your Fund Is Here CASE FILE 54AC003,"

Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Edward Durham. I am a US citizen and I am 52 years Old. I reside here in RESERVOIR 3073 Victoria Australia and I am thinking of relocating since I am now rich.

I am one of those that took part in the United Nations Compensation program in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me. I had paid over $25,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment but all was to no avail.

So I decided to travel down to Nigeria with all my compensation documents and I was directed to meet Mrs. Karen Woodlock, who is the member of COMPENSATION PROGRAM COMMITTEE, and I contacted her and she explained everything to me. She said who ever is contacting us through emails are fake. She also took me to the paying bank (ZENITH BANK) for the claim of my compensation payment.

Right now, I am the happiest man on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $5,000,000.00 more over, Mrs. Karen Woodlock showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email as one of the beneficiaries who have not yet received the payment under CASE FILE 54AC003 and that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people. They are not with your fund; they are only making money off you.

Therefore, I would advise you to contact Mrs. Karen Woodlock for assistance and inform her that your CASE FILE is 54AC003. Contact her directly via the information below.

UNITED NATIONS COMPENSATION AWARD PROGRAM

Name:  Mrs. Karen Woodlock
Email: mrskarenwoodlock1@onet.eu

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them because it is not with them. They are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.

The only money I paid after I met Mrs. Karen Woodlock was just the bank transfer charges, which is only normal and legitimate as it is in all banks in the world. So please take note of that. Mrs. Karen Woodlock shall ensure that you deal directly with the bank (ZENITH BANK).

Once again stop contacting those people. I advise that you contact Mrs. Karen Woodlock so that she can help you in the collection of your transfer payment instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank you and be blessed.

Hello Dear God,s Select Good Day,

I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears In my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, My Name is Mrs.Aileen Samih, and I am contacting you from my country Tunisia I want to tell you this because I don't have any other option than totell you as I was touched to open up to you, I married to Mr.samih habib. Who worked with Tunisia embassy in Burkina Faso for nine years before he died in the year 2005.We were married for eleven years without a child

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only five days. Since his death I decided not to remarry, When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$8.5m (Eight million And Five hundred Thousand Dollars) in a bank in Ouagadougou the capital city of Burkina Faso in west Africa Presently this money is still in bank. He made this money available for exportation of Gold from Burkina Faso mining.

Recently, My Doctor told me that I would not last for the period of seven months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I decided to hand you over this money to take care of the less-privileged people, you will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.

I want you to take 30 Percent of the total money for your personal use While 70% of the money will go to charity, people in the street and helping the orphanage.

Good Day,
My name is Mrs. Irene Shawcross; I am a dying woman who had decided to
donate what I have to the Charities based on the instructions given to 
me by my late husband Mr. Shaw. I am 70 years old and was diagnosed with 
cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death of my husband 
who was Marine engineer and a contractor from governmental tenders and 
other private entities, my late husband died accidentally under one of 
the heavy duty equipment at one of his construction sites, We had not a 
single child of our own to count on, We have been touched to donate from 
what I have inherited from my late husband for the good work rather than 
allow his relatives to varnish my husband's hard earned fund, although 
they have already looted and taken a lot. My health will not permit me 
to carry out some of the things, each day that passes by, I am afraid to 
die, but life gives me no choice, but to answer the call.

I managed to get your contact details online in my desperate search for 
a trustworthy person to assist me in this transaction, and he or she  
will also benefit financially. Recently, the doctors told me I might not 
live longer than 3 months after they diagnosed me of chronic/acute 
lymphoma or myelitis [leukemia]. Leukemia is a blood cancer in both the 
bone marrow and in blood itself, leukemia cells crowd out normal blood 
cells leading to serious bleeding and infection. I have been undergoing 
blood transfusion and it has drained My purse and little savings in my 
hand although I belong to the high and rich, but feed like a person who 
has nothing, as a result of this sickness. I want you to help me in 
carrying out my last wish on earth which will be very profitable to us. 
I want to WILL/Donate to you the total sum of $30.5 million USDollars 
(Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) to you which I want 
you to distribute part of it to any charity home for me in your country 
and the rest for yourself and your family which I will inform you on how 
to share all as part of instructions from my late husband before his 
death; You will get 20% of the fund as your compensation for helping me 
and my late husband to fulfill the project.
please for further information contact me ASAP. Please reply as quickly 
as you can, based on the fact that this is very urgent. You can also 
call me if you can, although I am in and out the hospital for treatment, 
but once the hospital gives me chance to use my phone I will answer your 
call.
Here is my Direct email address (  irshawcross@gmail.com  ) .

In my long years of work with top financial management companies in the United Kingdom, l and my Partner Mr. Hernandez have earned the confidence of most our high net-worth clients. I presently have two clients (Non Europeans) who have funds to give out for investment either on equity or loan basis.

The areas to be considered for the investment are as follows Real estate, Oil &amp; Gas, Agriculture, Health, Aviation, Tourism, Retail, Construction, IT &amp; Communications, Technology, Education, Energy, Engineering, Utilities, Telecoms, Mining, Maritime, sustainable energy and host of other profitable ventures.

Intending beneficiaries must have a business plan and show their capability to manage huge funds. The beneficiary must be able to deliver good and sustainable returns on investment to the investor annually. If you are that person or establishment seeking to expand your existing business or you have new ideas waiting for implementation, the opportunity is here.

Greetings dear friend

Please kindly pardon me for any inconvenience this letter may cost you because I know it may come to you as a surprise as we have no previous correspondence. I am Mrs.Maeve Michel  from Canada, I have been suffering from ovarian cancer disease and the doctor says that I have just few weeks to live. I am happy to know you, but God knows you better and he knows why he has directed me to you at this point, so do not be afraid. I found your email address from the internet after honest prayers to the LORD to bring me a helper and i decided to contact you if you may be willing and interested to handle these trust funds in good faith before anything happens to me.I am writing this mail to you with heavy sorrow in my heart, this massage mighty come to you as surprise but i chose to reach you through internet because it still remains the fastest medium of communication through this medium internet has been greatly abused. Please give me this little chance to explain myself to you, I would have like to meet you face to face before departing from this mother earth but due to the illness continue to deprive the chance but even if I die on the process of this operation I will still praise my God ALMIGHTY.

Now that I am about to end the race like this, without any family members and no child. I and my late husband have $10.5Million US Dollars in a Bank which I instructed the Bank to give St Andrews Missionary Home in Canada after this sickness started. But my mind is not at rest because I am writing this letter now through the help of my laptop beside my sickbed. We also have $10.5Million US Dollars at coris bank and I instructed the bank to transfer the fund to you as a foreigner business partner that will apply to there bank, That they should release the fund to you to start building orphanage homes and help poor people with it. But you will assure me that you will take 40% of the fund and use 60% to the orphanage homes in your country and other countries for my heart to rest.This money is still with them and the management just wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive the money for keeping it so long or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I cannot come over because of my illness or they get it confiscated. Presently, I'm with my laptop in a hospital here in where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer of the lungs. It is my last wish to see that this money is invested to any organization of your choice and distributed each year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless babies' home. I want you as God fearing person, to also use this money to fund orphanages and widows; I took this decision, before I rest in peace because my time will soon be up. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of them. I am absolutely assuring you that no trouble is involved in this money because this is my late husband money.

I am a dying woman and i decided to donate what I have to you for charity work/assistance to less privileged people in the society. I am just 53 years old and I was diagnosed of cancer for about 7 years ago, immediately after the death of my husband, who has left me everything he worked for and because my doctor told me that i would not last for the period of one year due to cancer problem.  I want this money to be share to the next privileged since I do not have a child to inherit the money and my late husband relatives all are non believers and I don't want my husband's hand earn money to be used in an ungodly ways. I am desperately in keen need of assistance and I have summoned up courage to contact you for this task, you must not fail me and the millions of the poor people in our today world. This is not a stolen money and there are no dangers involved, is 100% risk free with full legal proof.I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality and trust in this matter to accomplish my heart desire, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last wish. Respond to me immediately for further details, Contact me immediately.
Thanks and hope you will understand my point.

been waiting for you to contact us but we didn't know what is hindering

From Mr. Allen Beneth

Administrative Service Inspection Unit
P.O. Box 20509 Atlanta, GA 30320

ATTENTION: I am Mr. Allen Beneth Head of Inspection Unit United   Nations   Inspection Agency in Harts field-Jackson International  Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered An  abandoned   shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was  transferred   from JF Kennedy Airport. To our facility here in 
Atlanta, and when  scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money  in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes  weighing approximately 242.508IBS each. The  consignment was abandoned   because the Content was not properly  declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal  Effect/classified document to  either avoid diversion by the Shipping 
Agent or confiscation by the  relevant authorities. The diplomat's  inability to pay for Non  Inspection fees among other things are the  reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. By my assessment,  each of the boxes contains  about $4M or more. They are still left in  the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like  I said  are two metal trunk boxesI need all the guarantee that I can get from  you before I can get   involved in this project.

Hello,

I come to announce the good news about my trunk money,I finally arrive in this country to get my trunk money personally. God so merciful, I was able to recover it successfully, but I'm afraid to cross the two border with the luggage into your country. I need you to assist me in order to find solution together to get everything DONE so that we get my 14.5m dolar out of this country to your country for investment purposes. I have another solution thus, When I open the trunk money, I will take 10,000 thousand dollars and send to you via money gram so that you will use it to open a special deposit account in any reputable bank in your country where you will receive the balance. I will give you all and full details on my next mail upon receipt of your acceptance to partner with me in this money transfer. I have resolved to offer you 15% of the $14.5m dollar. Is this solution good?

I Hope to hear from you.

Sometimes, I do wonder if you are really, really with your senses. How Could you keep trusting people and at the end you will loose your hard Earned money, or are you being deceived by their big names? They Impersonate on many offices, claiming to be Governors, Directors/Chairmen of one Office or the other. Their game plan is only just to extort your hard Earned money. Now, the question is how long you will continue to be Deceived? Sometimes, they will issue you fake check, introduce you to fake Diplomatic delivery, un-existing on-line banking and they will also fake wire transfer of Your fund with Payment Stop Order and even send you fake Atm cards etc.

Anyway, by the virtue of my position I have been following this Transaction from inception and all your efforts towards realizing the Fund. More often than not, I sit down and laugh at your ignorance and That of those who claim they are assisting you, it is very unfortunate That at the end you loose. Although, I don't blame you because you are Not here in Nigeria to witness the processing of your payment in Nigeria. The problem you are having is that you been told the whole truth About this transaction and it is because of this truth they decided to Be extorting your money. The most annoying part is even fraudsters Have really taken advantage of this opportunity to enrich them selves At your expense. Those you feel are assisting or working for you are Your main problems. I know the truth surrounding this payment and I am The only person who will deliver you from this long suffering if you will abide by my advice.

They claim that they are helping you and you forward all the fraudulent e-mails you receive to them. At the end they do nothing about the fraudsters. Soon they will ask you to pay money to receive a compensation of millions of dollars Do not pay any money to them because they are only interested in your hard earned money and you will never receive any compensation in return, they will always keep coming back to ask for more money.

Please I beseech you to stop pursuit of shadows and being Deceived. Feel free to contact me immediately you receive this mail so that I can Explain to you the modus-operandi guiding the release of your Payment. Do not panic, be rest assured that this arrangement will be Guided by your Embassy here in Nigeria.

N/B: You are urgently requested to provide me with the following information

Full Name:
Address:
Telephone Number:
Passport Or National Identity Copy:

Contact me upon the receipt of this mail if you wish to receive your fund and stop wasting your hard earn money..

I await your urgent response.

A Road Construction Contract was awarded to a Foreign Company here in

the cost of Sixty Five Million Dollars (USD$65,000,000.00).

We negotiated with one Construction Company that executed the contract 
at the cost of Forty Five Million Dollars (USD$45,000,000.00) instead of 
the amount allocated by Ghana government. The contract has been 
completed and
the company has been duly paid.

Now, the reason why I contacted you: I want you to stand as the second 
Foreign Contractor so that the remaining balance of Twenty Million 
Dollars (USD$20,000,000.00) will be paid to you, then I will come over 
to your country for sharing and further investment plans.

I want you to know that all the processes are going to be legal and I 
will provide all the backup documents to make you one of the Foreign 
Contractors we have here in Ghana to ensure a successful transfer of the 
fund to any bank of your choice.

Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk-free because all the 
legal documents will be provided as I have already told you. Please if

 From The Regional Manager!

Best Regards,

My name is Mr. Johnson Kwame. I am a banker and a regional manager of a 
bank here in Ghana. I need your help to transfer a sum of 
US$7,500,000.00 into your account as my foreign partner.

The fund is part of the profits made by our bank past 4 years in the 
branch where I am the manager. I have already submitted annual report 
for last year to my bank headquarters in Accra - Ghana, and they did not 
notice the excess profits. I deposited this said US$7,500,000.00 in an 
escrow account without a beneficiary (Anonymous), to avoid any trace.

I cannot be directly connected to this fund because I'm still working 
with the bank. So, I need your help to transfer this funds into your 
account in your country for you and I to share. I offer you 45% of this 
funds as my foreign partner and 55% will be for me. There is no risk 
involved because it will be a bank to bank transfer. So, I want you to 
stand as the owner of this fund so that you can present a foreign bank 
account where the funds can be transferred to you as my foreign partner.

If you accept this proposal, I am prepared to go into partnership with
you. Please kindly reply to me for more information on how to proceed.

because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rat=
her it was declared as personal Effect/classified document to either avoid =
diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities=
. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other thing=
s are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. By my assess=

GOOD DAY TO YOU,

I know you might be surprised when this email gets to you . I barely know you but i wish to entrust some responsibilities to you.My name is Mrs. Bethanie Veronica Lee; I am a dying woman who has decided to donate what I have to you/church. I am 59 years old and I was diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer for about two years, immediately after the death of my husband, who has left me everything he worked for. He owned an import/export company which operated in the UK, west Africa and in china I have been touched by God to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you for the good work of God, rather than allow my relatives to use my husband hard earned funds ungodly, since we had no kids to inherit them.

Please pray that the good Lord forgive me my sins. I have asked God to forgive me and I believe He has because He is a merciful God. I will be going in for an operation in less than a month and I'll want you to stand as the beneficiary to the account of my late husband in the United Kingdom and in Africa. Also to the motherless and less privilege and also for the assistance of the widows.

You would be entitled to 20% of all the funds which are deposited in bank/finance house in the United Kingdom and in Africa. The remaining 80% will be used to set up a foundation in my husband's name, which will be used to help the less privileged. At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls due to the fact that my relatives are around me and my health status.

Please contact my lawyers in charge of the funds and they will arrange the transfer of the funds from my account to your preferred account as you would be the beneficiary to them.

Pls. Contact my lawyer in London,

I had the opportunity of explaining to her the condition of your fund starting from day one because she is a notable lawyer in Britain and  works with Financial Conduct Authority in UK and their solicitor,the lady told me that it will be difficult for you to receive the fund  from Africa direct to your account/country because of high corruption and undeveloped financial practice in Africa, she advised me that the  best way you can be paid is that she will send an application to (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS NIGERIA) on behalf of Financial  Conduct Authority London and the fund will be directed to UK under the authority of FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY BACKED UP WITH UNITED  NATIONS as an entity. She said that this arrangement will not cost you money for your fund to be in UK with F.C.A and F.C.A  will immediately move the fund to you she said that no organization can ever interfere hence the Financial Conduct Authority is involved, so

I have forwarded all your information to the lawyer in London and she have been in contact with (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS  NIGERIA) the god news now is that the lawyer contacted me yesterday confirming to me that your fund is with Financial Conduct Authority in  London,but she said that she will contact you first before F.C.A .

Greetings dear friend

Please kindly pardon me for any inconvenience this letter may cost you because I know it may come to you as a surprise as we have no previous correspondence. I am Mrs.Mirian Michel  from Canada, I have been suffering from ovarian cancer disease and the doctor says that I have just few weeks to live. I am happy to know you, but God knows you better and he knows why he has directed me to you at this point, so do not be afraid. I found your email address from the internet after honest prayers to the LORD to bring me a helper and i decided to contact you if you may be willing and interested to handle these trust funds in good faith before anything happens to me.I am writing this mail to you with heavy sorrow in my heart, this massage mighty come to you as surprise but i chose to reach you through internet because it still remains the fastest medium of communication through this medium internet has been greatly abused. Please give me this little chance to explain myself to you, I would have like to meet you face to face before departing from this mother earth but due to the illness continue to deprive the chance but even if I die on the process of this operation I will still praise my God ALMIGHTY.

Now that I am about to end the race like this, without any family members and no child. I and my late husband have $10.5Million US Dollars in a Bank which I instructed the Bank to give St Andrews Missionary Home in Canada after this sickness started. But my mind is not at rest because I am writing this letter now through the help of my laptop beside my sickbed. We also have $10.5Million US Dollars at coris bank and I instructed the bank to transfer the fund to you as a foreigner business partner that will apply to there bank, That they should release the fund to you to start building orphanage homes and help poor people with it. But you will assure me that you will take 40% of the fund and use 60% to the orphanage homes in your country and other countries for my heart to rest.This money is still with them and the management just wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive the money for keeping it so long or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I cannot come over because of my illness or they get it confiscated. Presently, I'm with my laptop in a hospital here in where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer of the lungs. It is my last wish to see that this money is invested to any organization of your choice and distributed each year among the charity organization, the poor and the motherless babies' home. I want you as God fearing person, to also use this money to fund orphanages and widows; I took this decision, before I rest in peace because my time will soon be up. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of them. I am absolutely assuring you that no trouble is involved in this money because this is my late husband money.

I am a dying woman and i decided to donate what I have to you for charity work/assistance to less privileged people in the society. I am just 53 years old and I was diagnosed of cancer for about 7 years ago, immediately after the death of my husband, who has left me everything he worked for and because my doctor told me that i would not last for the period of one year due to cancer problem.  I want this money to be share to the next privileged since I do not have a child to inherit the money and my late husband relatives all are non believers and I don't want my husband's hand earn money to be used in an ungodly ways. I am desperately in keen need of assistance and I have summoned up courage to contact you for this task, you must not fail me and the millions of the poor people in our today world. This is not a stolen money and there are no dangers involved, is 100% risk free with full legal proof.I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality and trust in this matter to accomplish my heart desire, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last wish. Respond to me immediately for further details, Contact me immediately.
Thanks and hope you will understand my point.

           {(RE: TRANSFER OF (7,000.000}{BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY/YOUR ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED}

Dear Sir/Madam,

I sincerely ask for forgiveness, for I know this may seem like a complete intrusion to your privacy but right about now this is my option of communication.

This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility. I am aware that this is certainly an unconventional approach to starting a relationship.

I am Mr. Marx Carlos, The Personal Account officer to the great late diseased who has an account in one of the top banks here in United Kingdom. The account was opened in 2004 and he died in 2007 without a written or oral WILL and since 2007 nobody has operated on this account again hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing and Govt. of United Kingdom will confiscate the funds for their personal use which I personally donâ€™t want such incident to happen being that this is a great opportunity for me and you.

My contact is for you to please assist me to transfer the fund (7,000.000) Seven Million British Pounds from Bank of lreland  Plc, here in United Kingdom to an oversea account. First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential. I am sure and have confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of this great magnitude. I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your safe account for onward investment.

You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new Bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing that you will never let me down either now or in future because this business is my life. The owner of this account is a foreigner and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of the company.

My investigation through the National immigration department &amp; Ministries here proved to me as well that he was single as at the time of his entry into the United Kingdom. The amount in this account is(7,000.000) Seven Million British Pounds, As a matter of fact, I have decided to transfer this fund abroad for investment. Your assistance as a foreigner is necessary because the management of the bank will welcome any foreigner who has correct information to this account which I will give to you immediately, if you are interested to do this business with me send me your account information as stated below.

There is no risk in this business. With my position and my personal contact with the manager of the bank,the money can be transferred to any account you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. We will start the first transfer with Three million British Pounds [3,000.000]. Upon successful transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining balance of 4,000.000 Million British Pounds to your account. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person here, but can only be approved to any foreigner who has the correct information of the account, which I will provide for you.

So you should provide me with your correct account details where you will like the fund to be transferred to, or you can setup a new account for the transfer even an empty account is ok. As soon as I hear from you and upon your strong assurance that you will not let me down once the fund goes into your account I will then start the processing of the transfer of the fund to your account without further delay. If you are interested, please forward the following information as below:

{1} Bank Name:............
{2} Bank Address...
{3} Account No:.........
{4} Swift Code...{if any}
{5} Account Holder's Name: ..........

So I decided to travel to WASHINGTON D.C with all my compensation documents, And I was directed by the ( F B I) Director to contact Agent Mary Elvis, who she a representative of the ( F B I ) and a member of the COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE currently in Africa, and I contacted her and She explained everything to me. she said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake.
she took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happy woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $2.5 Million Us Dollars.
Moreover Agent Mary Elvis, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name and email as one of the scam victims, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you.. I will advise you to contact Agent Mary Elvis.

Hey!  Hello there!,

Happy new year to you and family as we have waved a goodbye to the old year &amp; embrace the new year with full of hope, dream and ambition. 

I am Angela, it is so sad to write you about my late daddy's mysteriously death during his business trip, at first. My daddy of blessed memory by name late Griffith Walsh. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by cardiac arrest, unexpected loss of heart function in Burkina Faso on (16 June 2018) during his business trip of gold in Burkina Faso and are left with ($8,500,000.00) on his offshore account there.

God's Justice creates an opportunity to receive and make room for newness to happen in our midst. To be just in the eyes of God is to be fair. 

My father used my name as his next of kin and the inheritor to the money before his death, and he left a WILL with the bank that restrained me from accessing the money here unless I got married or found someone from overseas who will help me and invest the money wisely. As a university undergraduate and really dont know what to do.

The code of his Will forbids me to acquire such amount of money without been married or found someone from overseas who will help me invest the money wisely. He made the deposit as a fund belonging to his business in order not to raise eyebrow.

It is on this basis that I am contacting you for assisting me to receive the money, I located the bank, and have also discussed the possible transfer of the fund. I forced myself to contact the bank, but the bank response was that I should look for someone to help me secure the money as instructed by my late father. I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of my late father's tragic death. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Whether you can honestly help me as you would do to your own child?. While I continue with my education I will like to invest this money into lucrative business but I need you to put me through.

Please I am now seeking for your assistance to help me receive this money in your account abroad so that you can invest it in any meaningful and lucrative business of your choice because this is my only hope in life. I am willing to offer you 30% of the total fund if only you can help me out of my present predicament.

FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
OFFICE OF THE PAYMENT VERIFICATION PANEL
LAGOS LIAISON OFFICE
DATE: 12/01/2019

ATTENTION DEAR BENEFICIARY,


YOUR OUTSTANDING PAYMENT.


We hereby bring to your notice that your outstanding payment with the
Federal Government of Nigeria has reached this office for verification
and clarifications before the release. Anyway, without wasting much
time,I have personally investigated this payment down to the Ministry
were this contract was executed and from my findings it is clear that
you did not execute this contract in question, from all available
information, it looks like some officials in the Ministry were trying
to use you to claim this particular value which they over invoiced for
their own selfish interest. I know it might interest you to know how I
managed to find out this truth, yes. I investigated this payment up to
the ministry were this contract was executed and after some checks I
was surprise to see that the most vital/important documents regarding
to this contract bears a different name and beneficiary.

Based on this I decide to contact the supervisor that signed the
attestation report, on getting to the contract award and supervisory
commission I collected the contract attestation report and found out
that this document steel bears the name: B&amp; B PETROLEUM ENG.PTY as the
company that executed this contract. I keep this to my self and came
down to my base. As a matter of fact I have been thinking whether to
report my findings to the appropriate body for cancellation of this
payment, but I have this second thought of contacting you since I am
not a saint and in a position to approve this payment for the
president to give go ahead order to the release, I feel this might be
a Gods given opportunity.


So it is based on this I am writing you, if you will accept with my
understated conditions I can normalize all the relevant papers of this
payment and the funds will be release within 14 working days. Contract
attestation report is not in your name, the fund owner ship
certificate is also not in your name. Actually your partners as I
should say did a very great work in manipulating almost all the
documents to your favor.


Now, I want you to know that, with my position, I can amend this
problems and this money will be paid to your nominated bank account
which both of us will share on a 50/50 %if only you will accept with
my conditions.


So, if you see it wise to get this perfected with me feel free to
contact me through my private email address (
tonyebererepanel@gmail.com )


I shall let you know my conditions as soon as I here from you.


Thanks,
Tony Ebere"

Dear,

Sorry for the late response, it's because of the issue i told you i'm
having with my husband, he seized my laptop, i managed to retrieve it
to send this email, my replies might be slow sometimes because i
always hide to send you emails because he monitors me always, i saw
the documents you sent but the 3rd file couldn't download, are you
giving me your word and assurance that once i send the $8,850 dollars,
the compensation ATM card will be delivered to me at the hospital
address i gave you in Kenya? and i can be withdrawing cash from ATM's?
can i transfer money from the ATM to bank accounts? can i use the ATM
card on POS machines and online stores? remember the agent has to wait
for me at the hospital gate and text me that he is their so i can meet
him there, i don't want him calling my phone or coming inside the
hospital because i don't want my husband to meet him, i hope there
won't be any issue if i try to withdraw from ATM's? like i told you
before, i'm a Singaporean married to a Kenyan, we have a private
hospital in Kenya and another hospital in Singapore, so i travel to
Singapore often, if i travel to Singapore can i use the ATM in
Singapore, the limit i can send from western union or moneygram here
is $2000 dollars, so send 3 more names so i can split the cash while
sending.

If i send the money tomorrow can the delivery man depart Nigeria for
Kenya the following day with the ATM? answer these questions and give
me assurance, once i get your assurance and more names i will pay the
fee tomorrow.

Awaiting your response,

My Dear Friend, 
I saw your profile I decided to contact you for the first to and discuss with you for a deal proposer project plan that will benefit both us, And you are the type of person I need in this plan with your profile and your  name inclouded
the country you came from. and I believe that you will be a good person,

As I told you before my name is Ms Helena Marius from Norway, I am the Branch Manager of our Bank here in Ivory Coast for three years mission work from the government. I write you this proposal in good faith, I am a lady of peace and honest, and have sincere respect for human feelings and opinions. I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit you and I. As the Branch Manager of this Bank, it is my duty to send in a financial report to my head office in the capital city,  at the end of each business year.

On the course of  JANUARY, 2019 business report, I discovered that the
branch in which I am the Manager now in this program made 5.750 million Dollars   (5,750,000.00 Dollars) which my head office is not aware of and will never be aware of. I have placed this funds on what we call Escrow call account with no
beneficiary. As an officer of this bank I cannot be directly connected to
this money, so my aim of contacting you is to assist me receive this money
in your bank account and get 40% of the total funds as commission.

It will be simply a bank-to-bank transfer, and all I need from you is to
stand claim as the original depositor of these funds becuase its the same
name from your name and your country you from look alike. Who made the
deposit with my branch so that my head office can order the transfer to
your designated bank account under few working days.

If you accept to work with me I will appreciate it very much as you are
the first and the only person I am contacting for this transaction. send me
an email as soon as you receive this message if you agree to work with me
so that we can move over to the details. PLEASE WRITE ME BACK WITH THIS PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS (helenamarius407@gmail.com)

Have a pleasant day.

Ms Helena,"

I have very vital information to give to you, but first I must have your trust before I reveal it to you because it may cost me my job, so I need somebody that I can trust for me to be able to reveal the secret to you.

I am Charles J.Colocino JR, head of luggage/baggage storage facilities (Operations, Maintenance, and Transportation) here at the Harrisburg International Airport, Pennsylvania USA. During my recent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from London and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 110kg. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as ""MONEY"" rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is $3,700USD. On my assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the Harrisburg International Airport Pennsylvania till date.

The details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Trunk box. However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of the Inspection Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance processes so as a result of this, I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address for quick processing and response.

Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything concluded within 48 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery. Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to transact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment has not yet been returned to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share.

I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential. Please get back to me via my private Email :( colocinocharles8@gmail.com ) for further directives.

Thanks,

Charles J.Colocino JR

 He took me to the paying bank for the claim of my compensation payment. Ri=
ght now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my co=

me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and=
 I saw your email as one of the beneficiaries on the list he showed me, tha=
t is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are=

Dear Friend,
 Honestly after a serious thought, I have decided to personally reach you d=
irectly because I do not have anything against you, but your so called repr=
esentatives working with you to realize the remittance of your payment. How=
ever, have you ever wondered why you have been going this vicious circle ov=
er the past years with respect to having your fund paid to you without any =
success? It is possible that you were informed that your payment was brough=
t to me for finalization, neither were you informed that I am the person fr=
ustrating every move to get your fund remitted to your local bank account i=
n your country, I can assure you that this yet another deceit on the part o=
f your representative (s).Well, like I said earlier to you, I have nothing =
against you or your payment but I=2019m only trying to protect my interest =
also. I do not want to mention names here, but am certain you are aware of =
whom I am referring to having not received your fund.
  I am the Director, International Wire Transfer/Telex Department,Central B=
ank of Nigeria, the apex bank in Nigeria. Some time in the past a represent=
ative of yours approached me through a friend of mine who works with one of=
 the Government Ministries here and requested that I assist him conclude a =
money transfer deal having you as the beneficiary and we all agreed.Accordi=
ng to him, he wanted to use this strategy to transfer a huge amount of US D=
ollars by presenting your name as=201CBeneficiary=201D whose fund has not b=
een paid.
  Although we agreed that once I did that, he would give me 20% of the tota=
l fund and he will equally give me your contact information before I releas=
e the fund to your account. When he saw that I have programmed your fund fo=
r onward transfer and your name has been approved among the list of those t=
o be paid as beneficiary, instead of him letting me have your contact infor=
mation to enable me regulate the transfer of funds and confirm when it arri=
ve in your account to enable me send to you my private account details for =
my share of the 20% as was agreed previously, what he does was to start avo=
iding me and which thereafter,resorted to threats,because of that, I immedi=
ately deleted your payment initializing code (PIC) from the list of those t=
o be paid, and this made it very IMPOSSIBLE for the transfer to be complete=
d to your account.
  However, he your local representative became very angry when he came to d=
iscovered i was smarter than his plots could not work out as he wrongly wis=
hed. What he did was to start looking for other means of trying to bribe ot=
her junior officers to see how they could assist him secure approval to ena=
ble them transfer the money to you but all their efforts was to NO avail. I=
s it not so funny my good friend, that you as a beneficiary is being asked =
to pay several statutory fees over and over without your fund being transfe=
red to you as well expected. Well, your fund is right here with us and am 1=
00% responsible for the delay and obstructions of completing the transfer o=
f funds to your account because of the breach of the gentleman agreement be=
tween me and your representative abi initio. If you doubt what I have just =
told you now, then go ahead and pay any amount he may oblige you pay and th=
ereafter, he will subject you into another form of tax payment and it goes =
on and on WITHOUT SUCCESS. I did not reveal the payment initializing code (=
PIC) to any junior staff of the bank even till now because I want to avoid =
further betrayal hence no office can release the payment. I actually have t=
he power to remit the fund to your account but strictly on terms and condit=
ions. But, since I have gotten your email address through the bank data bas=
e network,I decided to contact you directly to resolve issues with you in o=
ther to allivate you from the long suffering subjected to you by your untru=
sted representative.
  AND AGAIN BEAR IN MIND YOUR PAYMENT IS NOT IN ANY OFFSHORE PAYMENT CENTER=
 FOR NOW and YOU WILL NEVER RECEIVE YOUR PAYMENT FROM ANY OFFSHORE CENTERS =
FOR NOW AS FOLLOWS LONDON, SPAIN, HOLLAND, DUBAI, not even the United State=
s of America or anywhere outside Nigeria BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY MAY HAVE=
 TOLD YOU. Now if you want us (you &amp; I) to work together for me to conclude=
 the remittance to your account, these are my conditions.
  (I). You must keep my information to you in this correspondence highly se=
cret because I don't want to get involve with he,your local representative =
again in my life and I will have 40% of the money if successfully transfer =
to your local bank account because it is only two of us in connection to lo=
gical remittance of the fund to you.
  (ii). You MUST assure me that you will not betray me at last and my own s=
hare will be safe until when I will redirect you to lodged my part of the f=
und into an account that i will forward to you.
  (iii) As you have seen, it will be useless and mere waste of money if you=
 continue with your local representative and i can assure you that with tru=
st and confidence we will conclude the transaction with utmost secrecy and =
confidentiality if you wish to adhere to my directives and  instructions. I=
f these conditions are acceptable to you, contact me as soon as possible to=
 let us finalize all the arrangement and conclude the remittance of the fun=
d to you immediately without any other delay attached.
  I will give you more important details once I hear from you based on if y=
ou promise to keep away from your local representative and handle this matt=
er with utmost confidentiality because I want to transfer the money without=
 the knowledge of any other officer of the bank or even without the knowled=
ge of your local representative .Email :  jluis011@msn.com

My residential address is as follows. 7901 W BUSINESS 83 LOT #1 HARLINGEN TEXAS 78552-0000, United States. am thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Cotonou, Benin Republic many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over US$35,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to no avail. So I decided to keep trusting God for a miracle because Almighty God never fails. One faithful morning, i received an email  from Lasayeth Young of which he told me that he  is the member of VALLEY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION &amp; also a member of the COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE in Alabama, USA, and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake from Africa are all fake.

He helped  me to claim  my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $3.5 Million US Dollars Moreover, Barrister Lasayeth Young, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email address as one of the beneficiaries, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you.

As soon as you contact him he will send you the payment information which you are to use in sending the payment to him in order for him to obtain the documents from the court of law there in Alabama so that your fund can be transfer to you without any delay just the way mine was being transfer to me.

Please save my life for the sake of God

How are you today and your family, I am a citizen of Sudan but
currently staying in Burkina Faso. My name is Miss Mariam Dim Deng,
26years old originated from Sudan. I got your E-mail address/profile
through my internet search from your country when I was searching for
a good and trust worthy person who will be my friend and I believe
that it is better we get to know each other better and trust each
other because I believe any good relationship will only last if it is
built on truth and real love.My father Dr. Dominic Dim Deng was the
former Minister for SPLA Affair sand Special Adviser to President
Salva Kiir of South Sudan for Decentralization.
My father Dr. Dominic Dim Deng and my mother including other top
Military officers and top government officials had been on board when
the plane crashed on Friday May 02, 2008. You can read more about the
crash through the below site:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7380412.stm
After the burial of my father, my uncles conspired and sold my
fatherâ€™s properties to a Chinese Expatriate and left nothing for me.

On a faithful morning, I opened my fathers briefcase and found out the
documents which he have deposited huge amount of money in one of the
banks in Burkina Faso with my name as the next of kin. I traveled to
Burkina Faso to withdraw the money so that I can start a better life
and take care of myself.
On my arrival, the Branch manager of the Bank whom I met in person
told me that my fathers instruction to the bank was that  the money
should release to me only when I am married or if I present a trustee
who will help me and invest the money overseas. I have chosen to
contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray my
trust.
But rather take me as your own sister. Though you may wonder why I so
soon revealed myself to you without knowing you, well, I am convinced
that you are the true person to help me.

More so, I will like to disclose much to you if you  can help me to
relocate to your country because my  uncle has threatened to
assassinate me. The amount  is $10.4 Million with some kilo of gold
and I have  confirmed from the finance security bank in Burkina Faso
where the gold is deposited. You will also help me to place the money
in a more profitable business venture in your Country. However, you
will help by recommending a nice University in your country so that I
can complete my studies.
It is my intention to compensate you with 30% of the total money for
your services and the balance shall be my capital for establishment.
As soon as I receive your interest in helping me, I will put things
into action immediately. In the light of the above, I expect an urgent
reply indicating your ability and willingness to help me.


Sincerely yours,
Miss Mariam Dim DENG"

Dear Prospective Partner,

I am contacting you regarding transaction linked to Former South Korean President Mr. Lee Myung-bak. My name is Duheong Kim, my friend Mr. Lee Myung-bak has presented a subtle offer which will need the help of a partner like you to complete successfully. Mr. Lee Myung-bak is in a difficult situation and he must immediately relocate certain sums of money. More so, this must be done in such a way that it must not be tied to Mr. Lee Myung-bak. The sum is currently deposited in the name of an existing legal entity. Your role will be to:

[1]. Act as the original beneficiary of the funds.
[2]. Receive the funds into a business/private bank account.
[3]. Invest/Manage the funds.
[4]. Value of funds: (US) $49 Million.

Everything will be done legally to ensure the rights to the funds are transferred to you. If you agree to partner with Mr. Lee Myung-bak, he will compensate you with 20% of the total sum for your role as the beneficiary partner to the funds. Should you prefer I re-contact you with more express facts, you can send me your:

"
330, colcharlesj1@gmail.com,Hello Good Friend,"



I have very vital information to give to you, but first I must have your trust before I reveal it to you because it may cost me my job, so I need somebody that I can trust for me to be able to reveal the secret to you.

I am Charles J.Colocino JR, head of luggage/baggage storage facilities (Operations, Maintenance, and Transportation) here at the Harrisburg International Airport, Pennsylvania USA. During my recent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from London and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 110kg. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as ""MONEY"" rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is $3,700USD. On my assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the Harrisburg International Airport Pennsylvania till date.

The details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Trunk box. However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of the Inspection Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance processes so as a result of this, I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address for quick processing and response.

Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything concluded within 48 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery. Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to transact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment has not yet been returned to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share.

I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential. Please get back to me via my private Email :( colocinocharles8@gmail.com ) for further directives.

Thanks,

Charles J.Colocino JR

14/01/29.

You may have been expecting an Atm card from a bank in Africa which has
never been delivered to you till date after several efforts you made to
retrieve the card.

We are pleased to inform you now that your transaction was wrongly handled
by cheats but God has exposed them and the secret behind your long
suffering over the receipt of your payment ATM card has been revealed to us
today as your ATM card with Ownership Certificate and other related
documents was caught in possession of one Phyllis Little at the departure
hall here in Lagos Airport.

The arrested criminal who attempted to smuggle out your Atm card to Atlanta
is claiming citizen of the United States as indicated in her ID which I
will send to you through email attachment for your perusal as soon as you
respond to this letter.

The criminal confessed she was aided by one Tunde Lemo who work with CBN
and one other Government official who is presently working with Federal
Ministry of Finance using her initiative to smuggle out the Atm card to the
USA so that they can withdraw all the funds loaded in the card and share.

This is criminality as the ATM card we recovered from her is bearing your
name as well as the related document attached herewith which is here in my
office while interrogation is still on as the arrested smuggler is now in
detention in the CELL while we proceed investigation to trace their agents
and crime partners for subsequent prosecution.

We have tried to call you with the phone number placed on the parcel with
no success but a man called me now from USA with a hidden number claiming
ownership of the card thereby asking us to redirect the ATM card to another
address he provided in California instead of the address placed on your
parcel envelope.

This is confusing as I do not know whom to believe at this point since the
content in the envelope(ATM CARD) can not be divided into two considering
the confessional statement made by the arrested person(Phyllis Little)who
told us you are the rightful owner of the fund loaded in the ATM card but
you died and made her your next of Kin.

Please confirm reality of this information by responding to this message
immediately as the Nigerian Police will not be held responsible if this ATM
card is shipped to the wrong person due to beneficiary's delay in response
or negligence.

My proposition is to seek your consent to present you as the next-of-kin 
  or heir of the funds. Hence, you have relating information with the 
late Mr. Thomas, the proceeds of this account can possibly be paid to 
you,  thereafter, and we could share the amount on mutual agreed 
percentage.  All legal documents to back up your claim as my late 
client's next of  kin will be gradually provided by me.




All I require is your honest and sincere co-operation to see this 
transaction through. This will be executed under a legitimate 
arrangement that will secure you and me from any breach of law. If this 
business proposition offends your moral values, please do accept my 
apology. I must use this occasion to implore you to exercise the utmost 
indulgence to keep this matter absolute secrecy whatever your decision, 
while I await your prompt response. Please contact me at once to 
indicate your interest and more details shall be provided and if you are 
not interested I advice you read and ignore thank you.



Note: This transaction will be treated personal with absolute discretion 
and sincerity. Meanwhile, the transaction is a secret and confidential

Dear Beneficiary

This letter is written to inform you the reason behind your delay payment.
I am Rev.Chris Amah the Director,International Remittance Department
of this Bank,my Formal Boss,Mr.Jacobs M.Ajekigbe,the Managing
Director/CEO of this bank is now on compulsory leave and all power
have been vested on me to make all international payments.Also,due to
reported cases of corrupt practices in other Nigeria Banks including
the Central Bank of Nigeria,the Federal Government has
revoked/canceled all power vested on those banks and has appointed our
bank (First Bank of Nigeria) to make all foreign payments.Be informed
that the Federal Government have approved the release of part-payment
of$7.5M(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) out of your total
funds,which has been in this bank for many years unclaimed because
Mr.Jacobs Ajekigbe,Collaborated with the Governor of Central
Bank of Nigeria (CBN)and have refused to tell you the truth on how to
claim your fund this is because he has been using the interest
accumulated from your fund every year to enrich himself without your
knowledge,I want to help you pull out this fund to your bank account
using the easiest and the quickest method,which have not been made
known to you before.By this method,you will open a domiciliary
account with this bank (First Bank of Nigeria),Where the fund would be
1st lodged into,before it can directly credit to any bank of your choice.
After the transfer,you will confirm the fund in your bank account
within 5hours the same day.No Cost of Transfer (COT) and no stoppage
from any Government departments as the transfer will be done within
the bank alone and it is very safe.The method which was introduced to
you before is the Telegraphic Transfer (TT) for which confirmation was
48hrs,because of the time factor,petitions could come from various
organizations stopping your payment and asking you to pay huge fee
which would be difficult for you to pay so that they can benefit from
the huge interest your fund generates while still in the Bank.
This method is not safe for you because it is not done within the bank
alone as information of the payment would be sent to the Central
Control Unit (CCU) of the Federal Ministry of Finance and office of
the Accountant General of the Federation.As a good Christian, I have
nothing to gain by keeping your fund,I want to assist you receive
your fund Before it accumulate Dumurrage.You have to follow up and
work with me now.
Ensure that you keep this very confidential because of fraudsters
and impostors who go about presenting various bank accounts in order
to divert another beneficiary's fund.
your advise to reconfirm the following details below to us with valid
account
co-ordinates and amount to be claimed.
Note your transfer code is FBXNZ7XX5M you must keep it confidential
to avoid intruder or claim by anyone so that I do not transfer your

I am Mrs.Susan Benson, I am a US citizen, 51 years Old, I reside here in America My residential address is as follows. 96 Clinton Dr Brownsville, Tn 38012 USA, I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $38,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to no avail.

So I decided to travel to WASHINGTON D.C with all my compensation documents, And I was directed by the ( F B I) Director to contact Agent Mary Elvis, who she a representative of the ( F B I ) and a member of the COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE currently in Africa, and I contacted her and She explained everything to me. she said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake.
she took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happy woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $2.5 Million Us Dollars.
Moreover Agent Mary Elvis, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name and email as one of the scam victims, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact Agent Mary Elvis.
You have to contact her directly on this information below.

COMPENSATION AWARD HOUSE          
Name : Agent Mary Elvis

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them,it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.
The only money I paid after I met Agent Mary Elvis was just $355 the paper work of my transfer,take note of that.
Once again stop contacting those people,I will advise you to contact Agent Mary Elvis so that she can help you to Deliver your fund instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

I hope that this correspondence is received with the urgency and expediency.

It has come to the notice of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Reserve Bank that your present inheritance/lottery/contract claims application being handled by the Remitting Bank is experiencing some man made irregularities.

We at Peter Simon &amp; Consults have been duly consulted by the FRB Board of Trustees. We have been fully informed about how the staffs of the remitting bank has been taking advantage of you by telling you to pay unnecessarily exorbitant charges which will only make your fund payment a long drawn out process. Due to this development, we have been assigned to step into the immediate processing of your fund transfer to enable your funds to be transferred to you within the shortest possible time; To implement this, you are to get back to us immediately stating your readiness to have your long awaited fund released to without needing go

You are advised to treat this communication with the urgency and seriousness required as the Board of Trustees of the Federal Reserve Bank has mandated us to resolve this fund payment within the next three working days independent of the office of the Remitting Bank in Africa. Furthermore,you are hereby advised to pay no further fees or charges to the Remitting Bank as they shall no longer be handling your payment process.

370, michealeric10@yahoo.com,Finally Your Compensation Fund Is Here//CASE FILE IS 54AC003.,"

Dear Friend,

I am Mrs. Dianna Gammel. I am a US citizen and I am 52 years Old. I reside here in RESERVOIR 3073 Victoria Australia and I am thinking of relocating since I am now rich.

I am one of those that took part in the United Nations Compensation program in Africa many years ago and they refused to pay me. I had paid over $35,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment but all was to no avail.

So I decided to travel down to Africa with all my compensation documents and I was directed to meet Mr. Micheal Eric, who is the member of COMPENSATION PROGRAM COMMITTEE, and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said who ever is contacting us through emails are fake. He also took me to the paying bank for the claim of my compensation payment.

Right now, I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $7,000,000.00 USD, More over, Mr. Micheal Eric, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email as one of the beneficiaries who have not yet received the payment under CASE FILE 54AC003 and that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people. They are not with your fund; they are only making money off you.

Therefore, I would advise you to contact Mr. Micheal Eric for assistance and inform him that your CASE FILE is 54AC003. Contact him directly via the information below so that he will help you too.

UNITED NATIONS COMPENSATION AWARD PROGRAM

Name:  Mr. Micheal Eric
Email: michealeric10@yahoo.com

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them because it is not with them. They are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.

The only money I paid after I met Mr. Micheal Eric was just the bank transfer charges, which is only normal and legitimate as it is in all banks in the world. So please take note of that Mr. Micheal Eric shall ensure that you deal directly with the paying bank.

Once again stop contacting those people. I advise that you contact Mr. Micheal Eric so that he can help you in the collection of your transfer payment instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank you and be blessed.

Good Day,
My name is Mrs. Irene Shawcross; I am a dying woman who had decided to
donate what I have to the Charities based on the instructions given to 
me by my late husband Mr. Shaw. I am 70 years old and was diagnosed with 
cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death of my husband 
who was Marine engineer and a contractor from governmental tenders and 
other private entities, my late husband died accidentally under one of 
the heavy duty equipment at one of his construction sites, We had not a 
single child of our own to count on, We have been touched to donate from 
what I have inherited from my late husband for the good work rather than 
allow his relatives to varnish my husband's hard earned fund, although 
they have already looted and taken a lot. My health will not permit me 
to carry out some of the things, each day that passes by, I am afraid to 
die, but life gives me no choice, but to answer the call.

I managed to get your contact details online in my desperate search for 
a trustworthy person to assist me in this transaction, and he or she  
will also benefit financially. Recently, the doctors told me I might not 
live longer than 3 months after they diagnosed me of chronic/acute 
lymphoma or myelitis [leukemia]. Leukemia is a blood cancer in both the 
bone marrow and in blood itself, leukemia cells crowd out normal blood 
cells leading to serious bleeding and infection. I have been undergoing 
blood transfusion and it has drained My purse and little savings in my 
hand although I belong to the high and rich, but feed like a person who 
has nothing, as a result of this sickness. I want you to help me in 
carrying out my last wish on earth which will be very profitable to us. 
I want to WILL/Donate to you the total sum of $30.5 million USDollars 
(Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) to you which I want 
you to distribute part of it to any charity home for me in your country 
and the rest for yourself and your family which I will inform you on how 
to share all as part of instructions from my late husband before his 
death; You will get 20% of the fund as your compensation for helping me 
and my late husband to fulfill the project.
please for further information contact me ASAP. Please reply as quickly 
as you can, based on the fact that this is very urgent. You can also 
call me if you can, although I am in and out the hospital for treatment, 
but once the hospital gives me chance to use my phone I will answer your 
call.
Here is my Direct email address (  irshawcross@gmail.com  ) .

383, barrister.gilbertbenoit@gmail.com,Happy New Year.,"

Good day,

I am Barrister Gilbert Benoit and I work with the Economic and Financial Action Task Force (EFATF) under the African Union (AU) Financial Headquarters in Togo. Please forgive me for not disclosing my identity to you at this stage for my security in case you report me. I will tell you more about myself upon the receipt of your positive response to my proposal.

Based on numerous reports from expatriates on financial crimes and diversion of various contract/inheritance/lottery payments belonging to them especially from member nations like Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Togo, and Burkina Faso etc. The African Union in her resolution at the last summit in Accra Ghana implemented new measures in order to checkmate such activities. They therefore mandated all banks in the African Region to submit all contract/inheritance payments files within the last ten years to the Economic and Financial Action Task Force (EFATF) for proper scrutiny so as to ascertain legitimate benefactors and have the respective funds released and transferred into their accounts of which we have concluded 12 cases and those that were cleared have received their payments fully of which we have received international commendations from the United States and EU.

It was during this process that I discovered a contract payment file belonging to Coastin Engineering Construction Company Limited with contract reference number snt/ped/war/98/2011 valued at the total sum of $US160 Million. I took great interest in this particular file and had it removed from the others when I discovered that the contractor/beneficiary of the funds is late. I carried out a thorough investigation on the payment file and I am 100% satisfied that the deceased has no known living relatives and if not for the fact that I removed the file during the last board meeting, it would have been approved for payment as it has met with all requirements and the funds would have been simply diverted and shared among the directors and nothing will ever be said about it as I am very sure that no one will ever come for it. I had the file returned back few days ago after gathering all necessary information needed as I can keep it for long.

Since I cannot put up claims for these funds based on the fact that we are not allowed to operate a foreign account which is in accordance to our Oath of Office, I therefore solicit for your assistance so that we claim the payment file with your name and have the funds released and transferred into your account for our both mutual benefit on a 50 basis without any difficulties.

I guarantee a hitch-free conclusion of this transaction and I assure you that you will never regret your involvement in this transaction. Upon the receipt of your immediate response, I will furnish you with details on what you must do immediately as we have little time on our side before a final decision will be taken on the payment file. With your immediate co-operation, this payment will be cleared and you will have the funds released and transferred into your account via bank to bank transfer with in Five working days. I need your immediate response as you are the only person I have contacted for this deal.

I anticipate your immediate response.

God Bless.

Dear Friend

I am so much worried all these while that you have not received your fund after several attempt and effort with some resources being voted  in.However,I have not given up effort for the actualization of your payment but my hands was tied up because of the constant problems  along the line.the format Today there is a good news about your payment,there is a seminar that took place last week here in Abuja the  capital of Nigeria  which involves some expatriate and it happens that I met one time course make when I was undergoing my masters degree who came from Britain,it happens that we lost contact for years but as God may do it she was among the entourage who came from Britain.

I had the opportunity of explaining to her the condition of your fund starting from day one because she is a notable lawyer in Britain and  works with Financial Conduct Authority in UK and their solicitor,the lady told me that it will be difficult for you to receive the fund  from Africa direct to your account/country because of high corruption and undeveloped financial practice in Africa, she advised me that the  best way you can be paid is that she will send an application to (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS NIGERIA) on behalf of Financial  Conduct Authority London and the fund will be directed to UK under the authority of FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY BACKED UP WITH UNITED  NATIONS as an entity. She said that this arrangement will not cost you money for your fund to be in UK with F.C.A and F.C.A  will immediately move the fund to you she said that no organization can ever interfere hence the Financial Conduct Authority is involved, so

I have forwarded all your information to the lawyer in London and she have been in contact with (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS  NIGERIA) the god news now is that the lawyer contacted me yesterday confirming to me that your fund is with Financial Conduct Authority in  London,but she said that she will contact you first before F.C.A .

Her information is:
Name: Barrister Adrienne Page.
Email:adrien.nepage.associates@gmx.com
Phone: +447452240165

Please wait for her email and let me know as soon as you hear from her by forwarding her message to me,I can give you 100% assurance that you will receive your fund this time so kindly work with her.You can equally send her message regarding to this update as you know that such lawyer may be so busy.

So I decided to travel with my son to FBI HEADQUATERS in WASHINGTON D.C with all my compensation documents to complain, And I was directed by the (FBI) Director to contact Mr. Albert Johnson, who is a representative of the FBI And I contacted him and he explained everything to me he took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $15, Million Us Dollars Moreover, Mr. Albert Johnson, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name as one of the beneficiaries, and your email address, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you and if they have not contacted you that means you are lucky so make sure you dont contact anybody aside Agent Albert Johnson regarding your fund which you are the rightful owner of it.

I will advise you to contact Mr. Albert Johnson directly today on the information below with his private e-Mail Address to know if he can help you too.

391, michealeric10@yahoo.com,Finally Your Compensation Fund Is Here//CASE FILE IS 54AC003.,"

Dear Friend,

I am Mrs. Dianna Gammel. I am a US citizen and I am 52 years Old. I reside here in RESERVOIR 3073 Victoria Australia and I am thinking of relocating since I am now rich.

I am one of those that took part in the United Nations Compensation program in Africa many years ago and they refused to pay me. I had paid over $35,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment but all was to no avail.

So I decided to travel down to Africa with all my compensation documents and I was directed to meet Mr. Micheal Eric, who is the member of COMPENSATION PROGRAM COMMITTEE, and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said who ever is contacting us through emails are fake. He also took me to the paying bank for the claim of my compensation payment.

Right now, I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $7,000,000.00 USD, More over, Mr. Micheal Eric, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email as one of the beneficiaries who have not yet received the payment under CASE FILE 54AC003 and that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people. They are not with your fund; they are only making money off you.

Therefore, I would advise you to contact Mr. Micheal Eric for assistance and inform him that your CASE FILE is 54AC003. Contact him directly via the information below so that he will help you too.

UNITED NATIONS COMPENSATION AWARD PROGRAM

Name:  Mr. Micheal Eric
Email: michealeric10@yahoo.com

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them because it is not with them. They are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.

The only money I paid after I met Mr. Micheal Eric was just the bank transfer charges, which is only normal and legitimate as it is in all banks in the world. So please take note of that Mr. Micheal Eric shall ensure that you deal directly with the paying bank.

Once again stop contacting those people. I advise that you contact Mr. Micheal Eric so that he can help you in the collection of your transfer payment instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank you and be blessed.

I am a deaf girl the only daughter of my late parents Mr. and Mrs. Dakota My father was a highly reputable business man (A

COCOA DEALER) who operated in the Economic capital of (West African Island) during his days.
I am a deaf girl.

It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.February 2015.

Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who traveled with him at

that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 14years old, and since then my father took me so special.

Before his death on February 12, 2015 he called the secretary who accompanied him to hospital and told him that he has the

sum of US$28,500,000:00(TWENTY EIGHT MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) left in a security company. He

further told him that he deposited the money with my name.

I am a deaf girl just 30 years old and university undergraduate and really don't know what to do, Now I want an account

overseas where I can transfer this funds and after the transaction I will come over and by your help I
could settle down and plan my future. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political

crisis here in west Africa. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards, I wish to invest under your care please. Your suggestions

and ideas will be highly regarded But permit me to ask these few questions:

1. Can you honestly help me as you would do to your own relation?
2. Can I completely trust you as a reliable person? .
3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you
after the money has been transferred into your account?

Dear Respectfully,

In my long years of work with top financial management companies in the United Kingdom, l and my Partner Mr. Hernandez have earned the confidence of most our high net-worth clients. I presently have two clients (Non Europeans) who have funds to give out for investment either on equity or loan basis.

The areas to be considered for the investment are as follows Real estate, Oil &amp; Gas, Agriculture, Health, Aviation, Tourism, Retail, Construction, IT &amp; Communications, Technology, Education, Energy, Engineering, Utilities, Telecoms, Mining, Maritime, sustainable energy and host of other profitable ventures.

Intending beneficiaries must have a business plan and show their capability to manage huge funds. The beneficiary must be able to deliver good and sustainable returns on investment to the investor annually. If you are that person or establishment seeking to expand your existing business or you have new ideas waiting for implementation, the opportunity is here.

cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death of my husband 
who was Marine engineer and a contractor from governmental tenders and 
other private entities, my late husband died accidentally under one of 
the heavy duty equipment at one of his construction sites, We had not a 
single child of our own to count on, We have been touched to donate from 
what I have inherited from my late husband for the good work rather than 
allow his relatives to varnish my husband's hard earned fund, although 
they have already looted and taken a lot. My health will not permit me 
to carry out some of the things, each day that passes by, I am afraid to 
die, but life gives me no choice, but to answer the call.

I managed to get your contact details online in my desperate search for 
a trustworthy person to assist me in this transaction, and he or she  
will also benefit financially. Recently, the doctors told me I might not 
live longer than 3 months after they diagnosed me of chronic/acute 
lymphoma or myelitis [leukemia]. Leukemia is a blood cancer in both the 
bone marrow and in blood itself, leukemia cells crowd out normal blood 
cells leading to serious bleeding and infection. I have been undergoing 
blood transfusion and it has drained My purse and little savings in my 
hand although I belong to the high and rich, but feed like a person who 
has nothing, as a result of this sickness. I want you to help me in 
carrying out my last wish on earth which will be very profitable to us. 
I want to WILL/Donate to you the total sum of $30.5 million USDollars 
(Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) to you which I want 
you to distribute part of it to any charity home for me in your country 
and the rest for yourself and your family which I will inform you on how 
to share all as part of instructions from my late husband before his 
death; You will get 20% of the fund as your compensation for helping me 
and my late husband to fulfill the project.
please for further information contact me ASAP. Please reply as quickly 
as you can, based on the fact that this is very urgent. You can also 
call me if you can, although I am in and out the hospital for treatment, 
but once the hospital gives me chance to use my phone I will answer your 
call.

Since i have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives.I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to Mrs. Caro Edward, because i have not be able to locate any member of her family so that the proceeds of this account valued at ($20million)dollars can be paid to you as the true Beneficiary of the fund.

Dear Friend,

I am Mrs. Dianna Gammel. I am a US citizen and I am 52 years Old. I reside here in RESERVOIR 3073 Victoria Australia and I am thinking of relocating since I am now rich.

I am one of those that took part in the United Nations Compensation program in Africa many years ago and they refused to pay me. I had paid over $35,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment but all was to no avail.

So I decided to travel down to Africa with all my compensation documents and I was directed to meet Mr. Micheal Eric, who is the member of COMPENSATION PROGRAM COMMITTEE, and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said who ever is contacting us through emails are fake. He also took me to the paying bank for the claim of my compensation payment.

Right now, I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $7,000,000.00 USD, More over, Mr. Micheal Eric, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email as one of the beneficiaries who have not yet received the payment under CASE FILE 54AC003 and that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people. They are not with your fund; they are only making money off you.

Therefore, I would advise you to contact Mr. Micheal Eric for assistance and inform him that your CASE FILE is 54AC003. Contact him directly via the information below so that he will help you too.

Name:  Mr. Micheal Eric

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them because it is not with them. They are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.

The only money I paid after I met Mr. Micheal Eric was just the bank transfer charges, which is only normal and legitimate as it is in all banks in the world. So please take note of that Mr. Micheal Eric shall ensure that you deal directly with the paying bank.

Once again stop contacting those people. I advise that you contact Mr. Micheal Eric so that he can help you in the collection of your transfer payment instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank you and be blessed.

This letter is written to inform you the reason behind your delay payment.
I am Rev.Chris Amah the Director,International Remittance Department
of this Bank,my Formal Boss,Mr.Jacobs M.Ajekigbe,the Managing
Director/CEO of this bank is now on compulsory leave and all power
have been vested on me to make all international payments.Also,due to
reported cases of corrupt practices in other Nigeria Banks including
the Central Bank of Nigeria,the Federal Government has
revoked/canceled all power vested on those banks and has appointed our
bank (First Bank of Nigeria) to make all foreign payments.Be informed
that the Federal Government have approved the release of part-payment
of$7.5M(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) out of your total
funds,which has been in this bank for many years unclaimed because
Mr.Jacobs Ajekigbe,Collaborated with the Governor of Central
Bank of Nigeria (CBN)and have refused to tell you the truth on how to
claim your fund this is because he has been using the interest
accumulated from your fund every year to enrich himself without your
knowledge,I want to help you pull out this fund to your bank account
using the easiest and the quickest method,which have not been made
known to you before.By this method,you will open a domiciliary
account with this bank (First Bank of Nigeria),Where the fund would be
1st lodged into,before it can directly credit to any bank of your choice.
After the transfer,you will confirm the fund in your bank account
within 5hours the same day.No Cost of Transfer (COT) and no stoppage
from any Government departments as the transfer will be done within
the bank alone and it is very safe.The method which was introduced to
you before is the Telegraphic Transfer (TT) for which confirmation was
48hrs,because of the time factor,petitions could come from various
organizations stopping your payment and asking you to pay huge fee
which would be difficult for you to pay so that they can benefit from
the huge interest your fund generates while still in the Bank.
This method is not safe for you because it is not done within the bank
alone as information of the payment would be sent to the Central
Control Unit (CCU) of the Federal Ministry of Finance and office of
the Accountant General of the Federation.As a good Christian, I have
nothing to gain by keeping your fund,I want to assist you receive
your fund Before it accumulate Dumurrage.You have to follow up and

Dear sir,

KINDLY TREAT THIS INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL

Before I proceed, I must first apologize for my unsolicited mail to you. I am aware it certainly is not a conventional way of approach to establish a relationship of trust, but you will realize the need for my action. My name is Mr.Freddy Mongezi, and I am the head of the Accounts Audit department with a reputable international investment bank in South Africa. 

I would like to share this confidential deal and opportunity with you, with the hope that we can both work together for its success and mutual benefit.

This golden opportunity came up during our bank's periodic audit of accounts. In the process I discovered huge unclaimed funds(USD25Million) in the domiciliary account of one of our late bank customers. Our bank is currently re-profiling and consolidating all accounts to meet the central bank's regulations. In terms of our bank's policy, all dormant accounts must be re-profiled and funds transferred to our bank's suspense account by December 2019, if a beneficiary profile is not filed for claim before that date. Against this backdrop, my proposal to you is to present you to our bank to re-profile the account, claim and transfer of the funds to your overseas account for our benefit.

It is within my authority as the Accounts Audit manager in the bank to lodge-in your profile for re-profiling as the beneficiary of the account and funds, regularize and approve vital paper works that will be recognized, accepted and approved by our bank, and officially place you as the account beneficiary. Then you can request the bank to transfer the funds to your bank account overseas. This opportunity will be beneficial to both of us and I have worked out all modalities to secure a successful completion of the transaction. 

Note that this transaction is 100% risk free and there are no risks or obligations for any unsuccessful claim. I guarantee that it will be executed under a legitimate arrangement without any breach of the law either here in South Africa or elsewhere. Once the transfer is completed to your account, I will travel to meet with you and we will share the funds in the ratio of 50% for me, and 50% for you as your benefit. I urge for your full cooperation in this deal, and also to maintain an appreciable level of commitment and confidentiality, especially considering my position in the bank. The transfer will be done officially and in the most secure manner while observing all standard banking procedures. 

Kindly let me know if we can do this deal together, and reply to my private email address at: freddymongezi@gmx.net

Upon receipt of your response declaring your interest and cooperation, I will provide you with more working details and my private telephone number to expedite our communication. Should you be able to cooperate and assist to actualize this deal, please be kind to inform me as a matter of urgency.

Yours faithfully,
Mr.Freddy Mongezi"

I am Mr. George Jim David, Head Officer-in-Charge,  Administrative  Service  Inspection  Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Newark Liberty International Airport New Jersey. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in New Jersey USA, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed ATM CARD. The consignment package was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal Effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities.

The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment package is delayed and abandoned. By my assessment, the ATM CARD package contains about (8 Million United State Dollars). And it still left in the airport storage facility till today. The ATM CARD like I said the details of the ATM CARD contain your full name and email is in the official document from United Nations' office in United States of America where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your Full name, Phone Number, full address so I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents.

It is now left to you to decide if you are the beneficiary and still need the ATM CARD or allow us repatriate it back to United Kingdom (place of origin) as we were instructed. Like I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages if only you are willing to work with me with trust. 

You can either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the  necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the  destination of your choice.

I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will Appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential. Please get back to me via my private Email :(mrgeorgejimdavid@all.bg) for further Directives.

I need all the guarantee that I can get  from  you before I can get involved in this project.

He said who ever is contacting us through emails are fake. He also took me to the paying bank for the claim of my compensation payment.

Right now, I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $7,000,000.00 USD, More over, Mr. Micheal Eric, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email as one of the beneficiaries who have not yet received the payment under CASE FILE 54AC003 and that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people. They are not with your fund; they are only making money off you.

Therefore, I would advise you to contact Mr. Micheal Eric for assistance and inform him that your CASE FILE is 54AC003. Contact him directly via the information below so that he will help you too.

UNITED NATIONS COMPENSATION AWARD PROGRAM

Name:  Mr. Micheal Eric
Email: michealeric10@yahoo.com

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them because it is not with them. They are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.

The only money I paid after I met Mr. Micheal Eric was just the bank transfer charges, which is only normal and legitimate as it is in all banks in the world. So please take note of that Mr. Micheal Eric shall ensure that you deal directly with the paying bank.

Once again stop contacting those people. I advise that you contact Mr. Micheal Eric so that he can help you in the collection of your transfer payment instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank you and be blessed.

Hey!  Hello there!,

Happy new year to you and family as we have waved a goodbye to the old year &amp; embrace the new year with full of hope, dream and ambition. 

I am Angela, it is so sad to write you about my late daddy's mysteriously death during his business trip, at first. My daddy of blessed memory by name late Griffith Walsh. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by cardiac arrest, unexpected loss of heart function in Burkina Faso on (16 June 2018) during his business trip of gold in Burkina Faso and are left with ($8,500,000.00) on his offshore account there.

God's Justice creates an opportunity to receive and make room for newness to happen in our midst. To be just in the eyes of God is to be fair. 

My father used my name as his next of kin and the inheritor to the money before his death, and he left a WILL with the bank that restrained me from accessing the money here unless I got married or found someone from overseas who will help me and invest the money wisely. As a university undergraduate and really dont know what to do.

The code of his Will forbids me to acquire such amount of money without been married or found someone from overseas who will help me invest the money wisely. He made the deposit as a fund belonging to his business in order not to raise eyebrow.

It is on this basis that I am contacting you for assisting me to receive the money, I located the bank, and have also discussed the possible transfer of the fund. I forced myself to contact the bank, but the bank response was that I should look for someone to help me secure the money as instructed by my late father. I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of my late father's tragic death. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Whether you can honestly help me as you would do to your own child?. While I continue with my education I will like to invest this money into lucrative business but I need you to put me through.

Please I am now seeking for your assistance to help me receive this money in your account abroad so that you can invest it in any meaningful and lucrative business of your choice because this is my only hope in life. I am willing to offer you 30% of the total fund if only you can help me out of my present predicament.

Regards
Angela"

From: Mr. Thomas Mills                                           
Tel: +442033897179
Union Bancaire Privée; (UBP SA)
Jersey Channel Islands,
                                                                                               PRIVATE AND URGENT
I am Mr. Thomas Mills, and I am contacting you on business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.

PROPOSITION:

I am an account manager with UBP Bank here in Jersey Channel Islands, in charge of all nonresident accounts. I have been in this capacity working with the bank for the last 15 years and I joined this institution in 1983 as a junior clerk and worked my way up through the ranks. On assumption of duty in November 2002 I discovered a dormant account in my branch that was opened in 1985 in the name of Karl Henning  and I have kept close tab on this very account for the last 15 years and it has remained dormant even from the day the first deposit of (US$37, 000,000,00)Thirty Seven Million United States dollars was made  to this moment, we have been investigating this account for the past 15 years and discovered that Karl Henning was used as Pseudonym Name to open the account while the original owner of the funds in question was the late president of Philippines Ferdinand Marcos. The next of kin part was left blank hence it was impossible for them to have claimed the funds these past years or they have forgotten the existence of the funds entirely., in agreement with my senior executive officer we have agreed to expunge the blank portion of the next of kin and fill it up with the name of a would be partner who we can insert his or her name and start the process of transferring the funds out of the account to the new would be beneficiary. I also have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any member of deceased Karl Henning family to become beneficiary of this fund. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business Endeavour by furnishing me with the following:

1.Beneficiary name and address
2.Identification documents
3.Direct Telephone and Private Email Address.

These requirements will enable me make some internal re-adjustments and file your name in all the forms and other vital documents as next of kin to the Pseudonym Name Karl Henning which before now was left blank when the account was opened many years ago. Upon your reply, we shall then discuss the sharing ratio and advice you the detailed procedure to follow and achieve this once in a life time opportunity without any hitch. I must assure you that if you are serious and follow my lead religiously, these funds will be processed and released to you within 14-working-day period. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you, I await your Immediate Reply.

Regards,

Best regards!

This mail may be a surprise to you because you did not give me the
permission to do so and neither do you know me but before I tell you about
myself I want you to please forgive me for sending this mail without your
permission. I am writing this letter in confidence believing that if it is
the will of God for you to help me and my family, God almighty will bless
and reward you abundantly. I need an honest and trust worthy person like
you to entrust this huge transfer project unto.

My name is Mr Kwabena Donkor, The Branch Manager of a Financial
Institution. I got your contact through a reliable source called database
through Ghana chamber of commerce. I am a Ghanaian married with 3 kids. I
am writing to solicit your assistance to transfer a fund $12.5 million
which is the excess of what my branch in which I am the manager made as
profit last year (i.e. 2017 financial year). I have already submitted an
annual report for last year to my head office in Accra-Ghana as I have
watched with keen interest as they will never know of this excess. I have
since, placed this amount on an Escrow Coded account without a beneficiary
(Anonymous) to avoid trace.

As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money
thus I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money
into your bank account on my behalf. I agree that 40% of this money will
be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign
account, and 60% would be for me. I do need to stress that there are
practically no risk involved in this. It's going to be E-online transfer
or bank-to-bank transfer. All I need from you is to stand as the original
depositor of this fund so that the fund can be transferred to your
account.

If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response to me.
This is why and only reason why I contacted you, I am willing to go into
partnership investment with you owing to your wealth of experience, So
please if you are interested to assist on this venture kindly contact me
back for a brief discussion on how to proceed.Please contact me with this

Theodoros Angelopoulos. 


Theodoros Angelopoulos (Herein after shall be referred to as my 
client), died late on Tuesday, 24 January 2012, several hours 
after being involved in an accident while shooting his latest 
film. Theo Angelopoulos the filmmaker had been with his crew in 
the area of Drapetsona, Piraeus Greece when he was hit by a 
motorcycle driven by an off-duty police officer. Unfortunately he 
lost his life in the event of the accident, since then I have 
made several inquiries to locate any of his extended  relatives, 
this has also proved unsuccessful. 

After these several Unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his 
relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of His family 
but of no avail, hence I contacted you to stand as his next of 
kin. 


I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money in addition, 
property left behind by my client before they got Confiscated or 
declared non-serviceable by the bank where this huge deposits 
were lodged. Particularly, Lloyds Bank, where the deceased had an 
account valued at about Nine Million Great British Pounds. 

Consequently, the bank issued me a notice to provide the Next of 
Kin or have the account confiscated within the next twenty 
official working days. 


Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 
5 years now, I hereby seek your consent to present you as the 
next of kin to the deceased based on the fact that you are a 
foreigner so that the proceeds of this account valued at about 
Nine Million Great British Pounds can be paid to you and then you 
and I can share the money. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% 
shall be for expenses or tax as your government may require. An 
attorney shall be contracted to help re-validate and notarize all 
the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any 
claim we make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable 
us 
sees this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed 
under a legitimate arrangement  that will protect you from any 
breach of the law. 


To enable us discuss further, I want you to email me the 
following information so I can open up a next of kin file on your 
behalf here in the bank.

child.He died after a brief illness that lasted 
for four days. Before his death we were both born 
again Christians. Since his death i decided not to 
remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home 
which the Bible spoke against but i have two 
adopted children residing in Canada.When my 
husband was alive, he deposited the sum of Â£33,
000,000.00 [Thirty Three Million Pounds Sterling] 
with a finance company in London. Presently, this 
money is still with the a security company and 
recently my doctor told me that it will take the 
grace of God for me to live one year more due to 
cancer problems.

Though what disturbs me mostly is my stroke. 
Having known my condition I decided to donate this 
fund to church or still a christian individual 
that will use this to fund churches, orphanages 
and widows and also propagating the word of God 
and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.

The Bible made us to understand that blessed are 
the hands that giveth. I took this decision 
because I don`t have any child that will inherit 
this money and my husband's relatives are not 
Christians and I don`t want my husband hard earned 
money to be misused by unbelievers. I don`t want a 
situation where these money will be used in an 
ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this 
bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence i

Dear Beneficiary

This letter is written to inform you the reason behind your delay payment.
I am Rev.Chris Amah the Director,International Remittance Department
of this Bank,my Formal Boss,Mr.Jacobs M.Ajekigbe,the Managing
Director/CEO of this bank is now on compulsory leave and all power
have been vested on me to make all international payments.Also,due to
reported cases of corrupt practices in other Nigeria Banks including
the Central Bank of Nigeria,the Federal Government has
revoked/canceled all power vested on those banks and has appointed our
bank (First Bank of Nigeria) to make all foreign payments.Be informed
that the Federal Government have approved the release of part-payment
of$7.5M(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) out of your total
funds,which has been in this bank for many years unclaimed because
Mr.Jacobs Ajekigbe,Collaborated with the Governor of Central
Bank of Nigeria (CBN)and have refused to tell you the truth on how to
claim your fund this is because he has been using the interest
accumulated from your fund every year to enrich himself without your
knowledge,I want to help you pull out this fund to your bank account
using the easiest and the quickest method,which have not been made
known to you before.By this method,you will open a domiciliary
account with this bank (First Bank of Nigeria),Where the fund would be
1st lodged into,before it can directly credit to any bank of your choice.
After the transfer,you will confirm the fund in your bank account
within 5hours the same day.No Cost of Transfer (COT) and no stoppage
from any Government departments as the transfer will be done within
the bank alone and it is very safe.The method which was introduced to
you before is the Telegraphic Transfer (TT) for which confirmation was
48hrs,because of the time factor,petitions could come from various
organizations stopping your payment and asking you to pay huge fee
which would be difficult for you to pay so that they can benefit from
the huge interest your fund generates while still in the Bank.
This method is not safe for you because it is not done within the bank
alone as information of the payment would be sent to the Central
Control Unit (CCU) of the Federal Ministry of Finance and office of
the Accountant General of the Federation.As a good Christian, I have
nothing to gain by keeping your fund,I want to assist you receive
your fund Before it accumulate Dumurrage.You have to follow up and
work with me now.
Ensure that you keep this very confidential because of fraudsters
and impostors who go about presenting various bank accounts in order
to divert another beneficiary's fund.
your advise to reconfirm the following details below to us with valid
account
co-ordinates and amount to be claimed.
Note your transfer code is FBXNZ7XX5M you must keep it confidential
to avoid intruder or claim by anyone so that I do not transfer your
fund to the wrong Bank Account.

Attention,

I am Mr. David Moyes, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 130kg.


The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.
By my assessment, each of the boxes contains $4M  which is total of $8Million USD. They are  still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two  metal trunk boxes weighing about 65kg each (Internal dimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name and email on the official document from United Nations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, full address so I  can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK. (place of origin) as we were instructed.

(Reply to this email : ( mr.davidmoyes881@yahoo.com  )

As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something  out of it (financial gratification). You can either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the  necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the  destination of your choice. I need all the guarantee that I can get from  you before I can get involved in this project.

was alive he deposited the sum of US$30 Million United state Dollars

Good day dear!

I am Federica Scondanibbio, Attorney at law. A deceased client of mine,
that shares the same last name as yours, who died as the result of a
heart-related condition in March 12th 2009. His heart condition was due 
to
the death of all the members of his family in the plan crash in January
10th 2009.

I have contacted you to assist in distributing the money left behind by 
my
client before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank 
where
this deposit valued at Forty Eight Million US Dollars ($48,000,000.00) 
is
lodged. This bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin, or 
the
account will be confiscated.

My proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as the
next-of-kin and beneficiary of my named client, since you have the same
last name, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. Then 
we
can share the amount on a mutually agreed-upon percentage. All legal
documents to back up your claim as my client's next-of-kin will be
provided. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this
transaction through.

This will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect 
you
from many breach of the law. If this business proposition offends your
moral values, do accept my apology. I must use this opportunity to 
implore
you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinary
confidential, whatever your decision, while I await your prompt 
response.

He said who ever is contacting us through emails are fake. He also took me to the paying bank for the claim of my compensation payment.

Right now, I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $7,000,000.00 USD, More over, Mr. Micheal Eric, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email as one of the beneficiaries who have not yet received the payment under CASE FILE 54AC003 and that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people. They are not with your fund; they are only making money off you.

Therefore, I would advise you to contact Mr. Micheal Eric for assistance and inform him that your CASE FILE is 54AC003. Contact him directly via the information below so that he will help you too.

UNITED NATIONS COMPENSATION AWARD PROGRAM

Name:  Mr. Micheal Eric
Email: michealeric10@yahoo.com

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them because it is not with them. They are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.

The only money I paid after I met Mr. Micheal Eric was just the bank transfer charges, which is only normal and legitimate as it is in all banks in the world. So please take note of that Mr. Micheal Eric shall ensure that you deal directly with the paying bank.

Once again stop contacting those people. I advise that you contact Mr. Micheal Eric so that he can help you in the collection of your transfer payment instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank you and be blessed.

Hey!  Hello there!,

Happy new year to you and family as we have waved a goodbye to the old year &amp; embrace the new year with full of hope, dream and ambition. 

I am Angela, it is so sad to write you about my late daddy's mysteriously death during his business trip, at first. My daddy of blessed memory by name late Griffith Walsh. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by cardiac arrest, unexpected loss of heart function in Burkina Faso on (16 June 2018) during his business trip of gold in Burkina Faso and are left with ($8,500,000.00) on his offshore account there.

God's Justice creates an opportunity to receive and make room for newness to happen in our midst. To be just in the eyes of God is to be fair. 

My father used my name as his next of kin and the inheritor to the money before his death, and he left a WILL with the bank that restrained me from accessing the money here unless I got married or found someone from overseas who will help me and invest the money wisely. As a university undergraduate and really dont know what to do.

The code of his Will forbids me to acquire such amount of money without been married or found someone from overseas who will help me invest the money wisely. He made the deposit as a fund belonging to his business in order not to raise eyebrow.

It is on this basis that I am contacting you for assisting me to receive the money, I located the bank, and have also discussed the possible transfer of the fund. I forced myself to contact the bank, but the bank response was that I should look for someone to help me secure the money as instructed by my late father. I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of my late father's tragic death. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Whether you can honestly help me as you would do to your own child?. While I continue with my education I will like to invest this money into lucrative business but I need you to put me through.

Please I am now seeking for your assistance to help me receive this money in your account abroad so that you can invest it in any meaningful and lucrative business of your choice because this is my only hope in life. I am willing to offer you 30% of the total fund if only you can help me out of my present predicament.

My name is Mr Mark Nelson,i am the Director Inspection Unit, United Nations Inspection Agent. We are currently in  Oakland International Airport, California,United States for official inspection while i discovered an abandoned shipment from UK via Diplomat with Untagged name/email tagged on it, when i personally scanned it, it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a Metallic Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 65kg each. On my assumption, each of the 3 boxes will contain more than $5M or above in each.


On further investigation, i discovered that the consignment was abandoned due to wrong declaration of the content, also the Diplomat inability to pay for Non Inspection Fees, because he did not know the content of the boxes.

I will arrange for the boxes to be moved out of this Airport to your address, once we are through I will deploy the services of a secured shipping Company geared to provide the security it needs to your doorstep.

Now i want to strike a deal with you, in your acceptance i will proceed on this. I have the capacity to secure the release of your consignment with my status as a United Nations\Inspection Agent. You will give me 40% of the amount in the consignment and you take the remaining 60%. Consequently.when i cleare it,

If you are not in agreement with this proposal, please disregard it. But if you can meet with my condition, then we have a deal.  I can get everything concluded within 24 to 48 hours and proceed to your address for delivery upon your acceptance. Write me on this email:marknelosn@usa.com if you accepts to work with me.Send me your cell phone number and your address and your full name.

Sometimes, I do wonder if you are really, really with your senses. How Coul=
d you keep trusting people and at the end you will loose your hard Earned m=
oney, or are you being deceived by their big names? They Impersonate on man=
y offices, claiming to be Governors, Directors/Chairmen of one Office or th=
e other. Their game plan is only just to extort your hard Earned money. Now=
, the question is how long you will continue to be Deceived? Sometimes, the=
y will issue you fake check, introduce you to fake Diplomatic delivery, un-=
existing on-line banking and they will also fake wire transfer of Your fund=
 with Payment Stop Order and even send you fake Atm cards etc.
 Anyway, by the virtue of my position I have been following this Transactio=
n from inception and all your efforts towards realizing the Fund. More ofte=

473, vikturr2@gmail.com,RE: THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN RECEIVING YOUR FUND,"



-- 
Dear Beloved Friend
Happy new year.

RE: THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN RECEIVING YOUR FUND

After waiting to hear from you or your Ghana partner for a long time 
now, I decided to make this direct approach to you as my new resolution 
in other not to let it be if I have anything in mind against you. I do 
not know if you have asked yourself why each time the release of this 
fund is approved, all of a sudden, the payment will be stopped or one 
problem or the other will come up if you have not asked this question or 
you do not know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.

Some time ago, your Ghanaian friends, I mean the people that introduced 
you to the project approached me through my dear wife who work with the 
Federal Ministry of Finance and requested me to assist them conclude a 
money transfer deal they had with you. They requested me to assist them 
by removing the original contractorâ€™s name, companyâ€™s name and bank 
particulars from the Bank Of Ghana vetting computer and replacing them 
with your name and bank details in order to make you appear as the 
rightful beneficiary of this fund.

I agreed on condition that they will pay me US$100,000.00 as soon as 
your name appears as the beneficiary. I did as agreed and demanded to be 
paid, but your friends started telling me stories, they even told me you 
promised to send money to me.

Do you know that up till now, I have not received a single cent from 
them and have not set my eyes on any of them?  Based on their attitude, 
I decided to stop the fund release movement because I cannot be denied 
of my right in my own office considering the risk as it might affect my 
job..  Secondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute 
any contract in Ghana, although I am the only person privileged to know 
this information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is 
that I can see that you are still making efforts in order to conclude 
this project. Now I am ready to forget the past.

I do not need the US $100.000.00 any longer from you but a good 
compensation from your mind. I need your assurance that those colleagues 
will be totally kept out of this transaction. I know that none of them 
is aware of my new approach to you. Stop spending your money 
unnecessarily to Bank of Ghana Officers both here and overseas because 
you will not receive this money without my hand in it. I personally did 
the work at the beginning and only I can perform it. Finally,

I need your promise that no official of the Bank of Ghana will be aware 
of my involvement in this regard because of my position. Now re-assure 
me that you will be willing to compensate me and that you will assist my 
wife to establish a foreign account in your country where my 
compensation will be lodged.  Also a TT FUND RELEASE APPROVAL DOCUMENTS 
will be sent to you for endorsement after which I will remit the money 
within 48 hours.

I am a man of my word. If you are ready to conclude this business with 
me, kindly contact me on my mail so that we can have a chat over this 
issue once and for all.  But if the reverse is the case, do not bother 
yourself to reach me and forget about this money.

BEST REGARDS

Attention Dear Friend,

This is important, and requires your immediate attention! First, I must 
solicit your strictest confidence in the transaction.

To intimate you further, we are top officials of the new civilian 
administration Committee on Foreign and Local Contract Payment, who are 
interested in the importation of goods into our country with funds which 
are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to actualize this dream, we 
seek your assistance to transfer the said-trapped fund into an interest 
bearing account which you have absolute control over in your country or 
a third country other than Nigeria.

The new civilian administration of Muhammadu BuharI (rtd) set-up this 
committee specifically to review all contracts/oil licenses to determine 
their propriety and relevance in the light of the country's current 
economic and political realities. We have identified a lot of inflated 
contract fund which are currently floating in our Apex Bank. At this 
moment we have worked out modalities withing ourselves and some 
acquaintances at the Apex Bank to divert the sum of US$93,700,000.00 
(Ninety three million, seven hundred thousand United States Dollars) 
only, for our personal use.

However, by virtue of our positions as Civil Servants and members of the 
Contract Review Panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names, 
consequently, I was delegated by my colleagues as a matter of trust to 
look for an overseas partner into whose account we can transfer this sum 
of money, hence this letter to you. Furthermore, my colleagues and I are 
willing to transfer the total sum of US$93,700,000.00 (Ninety three 
million, seven hundred thousand United States Dollars) into your account 
for disbursement. Your areas of specialization is not a hindrance to the 
successful execution of this transaction and the account required for 
this project can either be PERSONAL, COMPANY or an OFFSHORE account you 
have total control over. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at 
this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of 
this sum while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses between 
the parties in the course of this transaction. You must however note 
that this transaction is subject to the  following terms and 
conditions:-

(a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence
(b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality.
(c) That the funds would be transferred to an account where you have 
absolute control over.
(d) That one of our representatives will be with you in your country to 
represent our interest. This however depends on your response to 
conditions A and C above.

Modalities have been worked out to the highest level for the immediate 
transfer of the funds within 21 working days subject to your 
satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role 
is RISK FREE. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves and 
for mutual security of the funds, the whole approval procedures will be 
officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any 
company you may nominates as the bonafide beneficiary.

Once more, I want you to understand that having put over 23 years in the 
civil service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career 
dented. This matter should be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency.

Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include 
this transfer in this batch as payments to foreign contractors is 
usually carried out on quarterly basis. Contact me on my E-mail address: 
1do11@diplomats.com or my telephone number is +234-90-9991-6777 Fax: 
+234-1-745-5092. This is my special diplomatic number for government

Good day,

This is a personal email directed to you and I request that it be treated
as such. I am Alex McCann,a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney/sole executor to the late Mr Edward , hereinafter referred to as
'my client' who worked as an independent oil magnate in my country and who died in a car crash with his immediate family on the 4th of Oct,2014 Since the death of my client in Oct,2014, I have written several letters to the embassy with an intent to locate any of his extended relatives whom shall be C l a i m a n t s /Beneficiaries of his abandoned personal estate and all such efforts have been to no avail.

More so,I have received official letters in the last few weeks suggesting
a likely proceeding for confiscation of his abandoned personal assets in
line with existing laws by the bank in which my client deposited of the
sum of $14.5M,(Fourteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars only)On this note i decided to search for a credible person and finding that you bear a similar last name, I decided to contact you, that I may,with your consent, present you to the""trustee""bank as my late client's surviving family member so as to enable you put up a claim to the bank in that capacity as a next of kin of my client. I find this possible for the fuller reasons that you bear a similar last name with my client making it a lot easier for you to put up a claim in that capacity.I propose that 50% of the net sum will accrue to you at the conclusion of this deal in so far as I do not incur further expenses.

Therefore, to facilitate the immediate transfer of this fund, you need,
first to contact me via Email and send me your phone number signifying
your interest and as soon as I obtain your confidence, I will immediately
appraise you with the complete details as well as send you the
documents,with which you are to proceed and i shall direct on how to put

step to take.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this proposal is
hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fears as the required
arrangements have been made for the completion of this transfer.Like I

482, mrspaulac@yahoo.ca,PLEASE TREAT THIS AS URGENT,"

Hello,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, 
I believe everyone will die someday.I'm Mrs Paula Chehab im born 
in Kuwait and I'm a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I worked 
with Kuwait oil Company (KOC ) for eight years as a contractor. I 
have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer for months now .It has 
defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only 
about a few months to live,according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I ever really 
cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I was 
very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people 
and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I 
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is 
more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in 
the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to 
this world I would live my life a different way from how I have 
lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my 
property and assets to my immediate and extended family members 
as well as a few close friends. so, I have decided to give alms 
to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last 
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to 
some charity organizations . *

Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this 
myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of 
my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to 
charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and 
kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, 
as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.

The only person I would have trusted to do this with is my lawyer 
but he is a very busy man as he is occupied with other official 
tasks, thus he would not have the time to assist me with this 
mission as I want to see this done before my death.

I am Mr. Thomas Mills, and I am contacting you on business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.

PROPOSITION:

I am an account manager with UBP Bank here in Jersey Channel Islands, in charge of all nonresident accounts. I have been in this capacity working with the bank for the last 15 years and I joined this institution in 1983 as a junior clerk and worked my way up through the ranks. On assumption of duty in November 2002 I discovered a dormant account in my branch that was opened in 1985 in the name of Karl Henning  and I have kept close tab on this very account for the last 15 years and it has remained dormant even from the day the first deposit of (US$37, 000,000,00)Thirty Seven Million United States dollars was made  to this moment, we have been investigating this account for the past 15 years and discovered that Karl Henning was used as Pseudonym Name to open the account while the original owner of the funds in question was the late president of Philippines Ferdinand Marcos. The next of kin part was left blank hence it was impossible for them to have claimed the funds these past years or they have forgotten the existence of the funds entirely., in agreement with my senior executive officer we have agreed to expunge the blank portion of the next of kin and fill it up with the name of a would be partner who we can insert his or her name and start the process of transferring the funds out of the account to the new would be beneficiary. I also have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any member of deceased Karl Henning family to become beneficiary of this fund. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business Endeavour by furnishing me with the following:

1.Beneficiary name and address
2.Identification documents
3.Direct Telephone and Private Email Address.

These requirements will enable me make some internal re-adjustments and file your name in all the forms and other vital documents as next of kin to the Pseudonym Name Karl Henning which before now was left blank when the account was opened many years ago. Upon your reply, we shall then discuss the sharing ratio and advice you the detailed procedure to follow and achieve this once in a life time opportunity without any hitch. I must assure you that if you are serious and follow my lead religiously, these funds will be processed and released to you within 14-working-day period. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you, I await your Immediate Reply.

Hey!  Hello there!,

Happy new year to you and family as we have waved a goodbye to the old year &amp; embrace the new year with full of hope, dream and ambition. 

I am Angela, it is so sad to write you about my late daddy's mysteriously death during his business trip, at first. My daddy of blessed memory by name late Griffith Walsh. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by cardiac arrest, unexpected loss of heart function in Burkina Faso on (16 June 2018) during his business trip of gold in Burkina Faso and are left with ($8,500,000.00) on his offshore account there.

God's Justice creates an opportunity to receive and make room for newness to happen in our midst. To be just in the eyes of God is to be fair. 

My father used my name as his next of kin and the inheritor to the money before his death, and he left a WILL with the bank that restrained me from accessing the money here unless I got married or found someone from overseas who will help me and invest the money wisely. As a university undergraduate and really dont know what to do.

The code of his Will forbids me to acquire such amount of money without been married or found someone from overseas who will help me invest the money wisely. He made the deposit as a fund belonging to his business in order not to raise eyebrow.

It is on this basis that I am contacting you for assisting me to receive the money, I located the bank, and have also discussed the possible transfer of the fund. I forced myself to contact the bank, but the bank response was that I should look for someone to help me secure the money as instructed by my late father. I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of my late father's tragic death. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Whether you can honestly help me as you would do to your own child?. While I continue with my education I will like to invest this money into lucrative business but I need you to put me through.

Please I am now seeking for your assistance to help me receive this money in your account abroad so that you can invest it in any meaningful and lucrative business of your choice because this is my only hope in life. I am willing to offer you 30% of the total fund if only you can help me out of my present predicament.

Good day,

This is a personal email directed to you and I request that it be treated as such. I am Alex McCann,a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney/sole executor to the late Mr Edward , hereinafter referred to as 'my client' who worked as an independent oil magnate in my country and who died in a car crash with his immediate family on the 4th of Oct,2014 Since the death of my client in Oct,2014, I have written several letters to the embassy with an intent to locate any of his extended relatives whom shall be claimants/beneficiaries of his abandoned personal estate and all such efforts have been to no avail.

More so,I have received official letters in the last few weeks suggesting a likely proceeding for confiscation of his abandoned personal assets in line with existing laws by the bank in which my client deposited of the sum of $14.5M,(Fourteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars only)On this note i decided to search for a credible person and finding that you bear a similar last name, I decided to contact you, that I may,with your consent, present you to the""trustee""bank as my late client's surviving family member so as to enable you put up a claim to the bank in that capacity as a next of kin of my client. I find this possible for the fuller reasons that you bear a similar last name with my client making it a lot easier for you to put up a claim in that capacity.I propose that 50% of the net sum will accrue to you at the conclusion of this deal in so far as I do not incur further expenses.

Therefore, to facilitate the immediate transfer of this fund, you need, first to contact me via Email and send me your phone number signifying
your interest and as soon as I obtain your confidence, I will immediately appraise you with the complete details as well as send you the documents,with which you are to proceed and i shall direct on how to put up an application to the bank.

Dearest,

This might come to you as a surprise but what I'm about telling you is nothing but the reality about your fund which has been held for so long with the Central Bank of Nigeria.

Do you know that all the money you have been sending to the officials for one certificate clearance or the other is being used against you? well this might sound strange but am taking this bold step because of my religious belief as a Christian. The truth is there a lots of forces working against you right from the last central bank Governor and the current Governor with other top officials of all the commercial banks in Nigeria,they have been frustrating you by delaying your payment. There is a way I can assist you get your fund without further delay and avoid unnecessary expenses,it is risky though but one has to take it, I have directed many people through this way,and they receive their long awaited outstanding payment.


What you have to do is to open a bank account any where you can within your country, it will be nice but you have to bear in mind that you will re-transfer the fund to another account immediately you confirmed the transfer of the fund from me into your account. I know why I want it this way. If you want me to go ahead, let me know as soon as you
get this mail,if the transfer is made into your account this week, it might be next three months that they will find out and by then, you have re-transferred the fund into another account.

client), died late on Tuesday, 24 January 2012, several hours 
after being involved in an accident while shooting his latest 
film. Theo Angelopoulos the filmmaker had been with his crew in 
the area of Drapetsona, Piraeus Greece when he was hit by a 
motorcycle driven by an off-duty police officer. Unfortunately he 
lost his life in the event of the accident, since then I have 
made several inquiries to locate any of his extended relatives, 
this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several 
Unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the 
Internet, to locate any member of His family but of no avail, 
hence I contacted you to stand as his next of kin. 


I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money in addition, 
property left behind by my client before they got Confiscated or 
declared non-serviceable by the bank where this huge deposits 
were lodged. Particularly, Lloyds Bank, where the deceased had an 
account valued at about Nine Million Great British Pounds. 
Consequently, the bank issued me a notice to provide the Next of 
Kin or have the account confiscated within the next twenty 
official working days. 


Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 
5 years now, I hereby seek your consent to present you as the 
next of kin to the deceased based on the fact that you are a 
foreigner so that the proceeds of this account valued at about 
Nine Million Great British Pounds can be paid to you and then you 
and I can share the money. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% 
shall be for expenses or tax as your government may require. An 
attorney shall be contracted to help re-validate and notarize all 
the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any 
claim we make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable 
us sees this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed 
under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any 
breach of the law. 


To enable us discuss further, I want you to email me the 
following information so I can open up a next of kin file on your 
behalf here in the bank.

Attention Sir/Madam,

Firstly, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been reliably informed of it's swiftness and confidentiality.

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am Mrs Kathleen Casey, a Manager at the United Bank for Africa, Benin Republic. I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

A foreigner, Late ship Captain Steve D. Lawrence ,an oil Merchant /contractor with the federal Government of Benin Republic ,until his death Five years ago in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at the United Bank for Africa, Benin Republic, and had a closing balance of US$20.5M (Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Benin Republic.

Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the United Bank for Africa to get in touch with any of late Captain Steve D. Lawrence's next of kin (he had no known wife and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman, board of directors, Retired Major General Joseph Gabba, that an arrangement for the fund to be declared ""UNCLAIMED "" and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund or an orphanage Home.

In order to avert this negative development , myself and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as late Captain Steve D. Lawrence's next of kin so that the fund,US$20.5M, would be subsequently transferred and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next of kin. All documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 40% of the total amount. 10% has been set aside for expenses, while the rest 50% would be for me and my colleagues for our involvement and we wish to invest our shares in real estate /oil business in your country.

If this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to take advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get to me immediately via my  e-mail furnishing me with your most confidential telephone, contact address and  e-mail and national identification card, so that i can forward to you the relevant details of this transaction. Thank you in advance for your anticipated
co-operation.

I had the opportunity of explaining to her the condition of your fund starting from day one because she is a notable lawyer in Britain and  works with Financial Conduct Authority in UK and their solicitor,the lady told me that it will be difficult for you to receive the fund  from Africa direct to your account/country because of high corruption and undeveloped financial practice in Africa, she advised me that the  best way you can be paid is that she will send an application to (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS NIGERIA) on behalf of Financial  Conduct Authority London and the fund will be directed to UK under the authority of FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY BACKED UP WITH UNITED  NATIONS as an entity. She said that this arrangement will not cost you money for your fund to be in UK with F.C.A and F.C.A  will immediately move the fund to you she said that no organization can ever interfere hence the Financial Conduct Authority is involved, so

I have forwarded all your information to the lawyer in London and she have been in contact with (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS  NIGERIA) the god news now is that the lawyer contacted me yesterday confirming to me that your fund is with Financial Conduct Authority in  London,but she said that she will contact you first before F.C.A .

So I decided to keep trusting God for a miracle because Almighty God never fails. One faithful morning, i received an email  from Lasayeth Young of which he told me that he  is the member of VALLEY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION &amp; also a member of the COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE in Alabama, USA, and he explained everything to me.

<p>Greetings, </p>
<p>Thank for your email &amp; indication of interest. Please, take your time and read my mail very well based on our conversation in LinkedIn. I 'm not offering you an employment opportunity, rather I am looking for a reliable person to handle a profitable business for our mutual benefit.</p>
<p>Brief Introduction:I was the former Purchase Officer of FURAGENE BIOPHARMACEUTICALS LIMITED , a reputable Pharmaceutical company here in UK. (<a href=""http://www.furagene.com"">www.furagene.com</a>) with registration number: SC399861 and Registered office address at 95 Links View Linksfield Road, Aberdeen, Scotland, AB24 5RL.</p>
<p>Recently, I was promoted and assumed office as the new Director Research &amp; Development. I usually visit  U.A.E and Indonesia regularly to procure some pharmaceutical raw materials  in the domestic market on behalf of my Company. Our previous supplier of the Raw Materials was a U.A.E businessman. He  died two (2) months ago after battling with cancer for many years. </p>
<p>During my time as Purchase Officer of the Company , I worked closely with late Mr. Abdulatif Salim to source and supply Local-Herb Seeds from some local Farmers and Vendors from Turkey. I often travel to Turkey to pick the product from Mr. Abdulatif Salimwhenever he purchased it from the local farmers. We inflated the local cost price of the local two Seeds and made good profits from my company. </p>
<p>
After death of Mr.  Abdulatif Salim , the C.E.O. and the Procurement Department of my company have tried to contact him through phone and several emails hoping that his business partner or any of his family member will respond to the mails. The Company wanted to sign a 5-10 years Retainer-Ship Agreement with late Mr.  Abdulatif Salim and pay him 50% Advance of Total Order Value, before he died  This proposal is one of mutual trust and benefit for both of us, it may not be your 
area of business but it will be another income generating business out of your specialty and it will not hinder you from your daily  business activities. Frankly speaking, It is 100% risk free! </p>
<p>My Proposal:I need a reliable businessman / individual from U.A.E, who can contact my company management introducing himself as  the business partner of Late Mr.  Abdulatif Salim , i will give you all the vital information about Late Mr.  Abdulatif Salim business transactions with my company management. </p>
<p>
I will use my position in the company to influence the management to  issue you an Official Purchase Order and sign a (10) ten years Retainer-ship Agreement with you , which is my main target and will also enable the company to  pay you 50% advance upfront. The profit accrued from the supply will be shared between us on an agreed %age  without the knowledge of the management. Believe me, we will be making a minimum of  almost  $2,125,000/-(USD) in every single 
transaction.</p>
<p>Company Requirement:My Company is urgently in need of  large quantity of two major Organic-plant seeds used for manufacture of pharmaceutical products and anti-viral vaccines. </p>
<p>i)  Polygonaceae local-Herb Seeds.ii) Leristicum local-Herb Seeds.</p>
<p>If you will sincerely work with me to handle this business for our mutual benefit, please indicate your interest for further clarification. I will guide you step by step to the successful execution of this first transaction between you and my company management. I will also ensure that you receive an Official Purchase Order from my company management within (7) seven working days after your communication with the Company management.</p>
<p>I am waiting to hear from you urgently.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; best regards,</p>

Attention,

I am Mr. David Moyes, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 130kg.


The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.
By my assessment, each of the boxes contains $4M  which is total of $8Million USD. They are  still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two  metal trunk boxes weighing about 65kg each (Internal dimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name and email on the official document from United Nations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, full address so I  can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK. (place of origin) as we were instructed.

(Reply to this email : ( mr.davidmoyes881@yahoo.com  )

As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something  out of it (financial gratification). You can either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the  necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the  destination of your choice. I need all the guarantee that I can get from  you before I can get involved in this project.


Best Regards,

Mr. David Moyes

I am Nicolas Pura Conzalez the Principle Attorney of a renowned law and 
auditing firm here in Spain. I was contracted to audit the accounting 
section of some firms in Spain. This audit in line with government 
policies and account reconciliation became necessary following the 
current European Economic crisis which Spain happens to be one of the 
most pretentious countries with the Euro Zone.

During my audits, I discovered several dormant accounts due to 
inactivity. some of the said account has been dormant for over a decade 
as the initial owner of funds are demised. Against this
backdrop, I decided to contact you in order to confirm whether or not 
you know or are related to the deceased family? This is because from our 
preliminary findings, your and one of the deceased happen to bear same 
surname and common heritage.

Lastly, owing to the sensitivity of this situation, I urge you to keep 
this proposal in utmost confidentiality pending our discussion. I expect 
your response to enable me send you more informations.Plese direct your

Attention

Re: Your Abandoned Package For Delivery

I have very vital information to give to you, but first I must have your trust before I review it to you because it may cause me my job,so I need somebody that I can trust for me to be able to review the secret to you.

I am Mr.Williams G. Emad, head of luggage/baggage storage facilities (Operations,Maintenance,Transportation) here at the Philadelphia International Airport USA. During my recent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from Africa and when scanned it revealed an
undisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately110kg. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as â€œMONEYâ€rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is $3,700USD. On my assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the Philadelphia International Airport Philadelphia till date. The details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Trunk box.

However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of the Inspection Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance processes so as a result of this, I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address for quick processing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything concluded within 48hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.

Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to transact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment has not yet been returned to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share.

I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential. Please get back to me via my private Email (offic.fille09@gmail.com)for further directives:

Thank you.

Dearest,

This might come to you as a surprise but what I'm about telling you is nothing but the reality about your fund which has been held for so long with the Central Bank of Nigeria.

Do you know that all the money you have been sending to the officials for one certificate clearance or the other is being used against you? well this might sound strange but am taking this bold step because of my religious belief as a Christian. The truth is there a lots of forces working against you right from the last central bank Governor and the current Governor with other top officials of all the commercial banks in Nigeria,they have been frustrating you by delaying your payment. There is a way I can assist you get your fund without further delay and avoid unnecessary expenses,it is risky though but one has to take it, I have directed many people through this way,and they receive their long awaited outstanding payment.


What you have to do is to open a bank account any where you can within your country, it will be nice but you have to bear in mind that you will re-transfer the fund to another account immediately you confirmed the transfer of the fund from me into your account. I know why I want it this way. If you want me to go ahead, let me know as soon as you
get this mail,if the transfer is made into your account this week, it might be next three months that they will find out and by then, you have re-transferred the fund into another account.


Get back to me as soon as you get this mail so that I will be in a better position to know what to do. Waiting for your immediate reply to this address ( dr.veronicaamadi001@gmail.com ).

 Dear Prospective Partner

Compliment of the season. I wish to first of all introduce myself, I am
Mrs  Meg Thillerson , I am a close friend  to former top aide of the former
Angola President`s son Jose Filomeno dos Santos who is charged of transfer
of $500M while head of the country`s sovereign wealth fund. He controlled
the $5BN oil-fueled sovereign fund by his father in 2013. The new regime of
Joao Lourenco has put up a motion to repossess concealed funds and even
legally owned funds from mineral exploration of all the regime former
lineage.

Owing to this development this colleague contacted me to assist for
subordinate link to convey funds further to safe haven. The link shall
simultaneously or gradually shift funds already sent to Uganda and Kenya to
his destination or safe haven for investment. The financial security firm
in Kampala-Uganda has consignment (delivery)  of $125M and 400 kilogram of
gold. A similar firm in Nairobi-Kenya also have a delivery of $85M and the
consignments number has been issued by the two firms in respect to the
delivery.

Hence I am mandated to search for reliable foreign collaborator for
investment of the above funds. After doing a great deal of research on
locations, I decided to invest in your country or as may be advised by you.
This opportunity may require your presence either in Kampala or Nairobi for
Memorandum of Understanding.

I will give you more details once you further establish communication with
sincerity of purpose to work with me in good faith.
Sincerely,

Meg Thillerson

NB:Am contacting you right now because it very urgent and needs a capable
and reputable personality And get back to me through my personal email
address on {maggithiller@gmx.com} thanks

 So I decided to run to the refugee camp where I am presently seeking asylum under the United Nations High Commission for the Refugee herein Ghana Republic,I wish to contact you personally for a long term business relationship and investment assistance in your country or anywhere in the world.

I shall forward to you with the necessary documents on confirmation of your acceptance to assist me for the Clearance and transportation of this properties and investment of the money in your country or any where you will like to invest the money.As you will help me in an investment, and I will like to complete my studies, as I was formerly a Medical student before the death of my father in a plan crashed on Monday 31st of July year 2000,13:22 GTM 14:22 Near Paris France during his business trip to USA new york,since i got the information about his death i was very confused because i don't know what else to do in life.

YOU CAN VISIT THIS SITE TO SEE THE CRASHED IN DETAILS,

Dear beloved,

Greetings to you! I am Mrs. Christy Walton, a citizen of the United States of America. I am a widow and a businesswoman. I bring to you a proposal worth the sum $14,900,000.00 (Million USD) which I intend to use for a humanitarian project. In June 2005, I inherited the sum of US$18.2 Billion from my late husband Mr. John T. Walton following his death in a plane crash.

I am happy to know you, I have never doubted my instinct as it has never failed me, even as it has directed me to you at this point in time so do not be afraid. I saw your e-mail contact at the department of commerce and foreign trade. I am writing this mail to you with heavy sorrow in my heart, it's painful to let you know that I have been suffering for esophageal cancer and a rare heart disease for the past 7 years and just a few weeks ago my Doctor told me that I won't survive the illness. I am contacting you because I don't have any other option but to open up to you about my project at hand. Please reply me back if you are interested so I can provide you with further details via: waltonchristy89@yahoo.com

I await your response.

Remain Blessed
Mrs. Christy Walton

Dear Friend

I am so much worried all these while that you have not received your fund after several attempt and effort with some resources being voted  in.However,I have not given up effort for the actualization of your payment but my hands was tied up because of the constant problems  along the line.the format Today there is a good news about your payment,there is a seminar that took place last week here in Abuja the  capital of Nigeria  which involves some expatriate and it happens that I met one time course make when I was undergoing my masters degree who came from Britain,it happens that we lost contact for years but as God may do it she was among the entourage who came from Britain.

I had the opportunity of explaining to her the condition of your fund starting from day one because she is a notable lawyer in Britain and  works with Financial Conduct Authority in UK and their solicitor,the lady told me that it will be difficult for you to receive the fund  from Africa direct to your account/country because of high corruption and undeveloped financial practice in Africa, she advised me that the  best way you can be paid is that she will send an application to (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS NIGERIA) on behalf of Financial  Conduct Authority London and the fund will be directed to UK under the authority of FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY BACKED UP WITH UNITED  NATIONS as an entity. She said that this arrangement will not cost you money for your fund to be in UK with F.C.A and F.C.A  will immediately move the fund to you she said that no organization can ever interfere hence the Financial Conduct Authority is involved, so

I have forwarded all your information to the lawyer in London and she have been in contact with (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS  NIGERIA) the god news now is that the lawyer contacted me yesterday confirming to me that your fund is with Financial Conduct Authority in  London,but she said that she will contact you first before F.C.A .

Her information is:
Name: Barrister Adrienne Page.
Email: adrien.nepage.associates@gmx.com
Phone: +447452240165

Please wait for her email and let me know as soon as you hear from her by forwarding her message to me,I can give you 100% assurance that you will receive your fund this time so kindly work with her.You can equally send her message regarding to this update as you know that such lawyer may be so busy.

-- 
Dear Beloved Friend
Happy new year.

RE: THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN RECEIVING YOUR FUND

After waiting to hear from you or your Ghana partner for a long time 
now, I decided to make this direct approach to you as my new resolution 
in other not to let it be if I have anything in mind against you. I do 
not know if you have asked yourself why each time the release of this 
fund is approved, all of a sudden, the payment will be stopped or one 
problem or the other will come up if you have not asked this question or 
you do not know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.

Some time ago, your Ghanaian friends, I mean the people that introduced 
you to the project approached me through my dear wife who work with the 
Federal Ministry of Finance and requested me to assist them conclude a 
money transfer deal they had with you. They requested me to assist them 
by removing the original contractorâ€™s name, companyâ€™s name and bank 
particulars from the Bank Of Ghana vetting computer and replacing them 
with your name and bank details in order to make you appear as the 
rightful beneficiary of this fund.

I agreed on condition that they will pay me US$100,000.00 as soon as 
your name appears as the beneficiary. I did as agreed and demanded to be 
paid, but your friends started telling me stories, they even told me you 
promised to send money to me.

Do you know that up till now, I have not received a single cent from 
them and have not set my eyes on any of them?  Based on their attitude, 
I decided to stop the fund release movement because I cannot be denied 
of my right in my own office considering the risk as it might affect my 
job..  Secondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute 
any contract in Ghana, although I am the only person privileged to know 
this information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is 
that I can see that you are still making efforts in order to conclude 
this project. Now I am ready to forget the past.

I do not need the US $100.000.00 any longer from you but a good 
compensation from your mind. I need your assurance that those colleagues 
will be totally kept out of this transaction. I know that none of them 
is aware of my new approach to you. Stop spending your money 
unnecessarily to Bank of Ghana Officers both here and overseas because 
you will not receive this money without my hand in it. I personally did 
the work at the beginning and only I can perform it. Finally,

I need your promise that no official of the Bank of Ghana will be aware 
of my involvement in this regard because of my position. Now re-assure 
me that you will be willing to compensate me and that you will assist my 
wife to establish a foreign account in your country where my 
compensation will be lodged.  Also a TT FUND RELEASE APPROVAL DOCUMENTS 
will be sent to you for endorsement after which I will remit the money 
within 48 hours.

I am a man of my word. If you are ready to conclude this business with 
me, kindly contact me on my mail so that we can have a chat over this 
issue once and for all.  But if the reverse is the case, do not bother 
yourself to reach me and forget about this money.

are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to actualize this dream, we 
seek your assistance to transfer the said-trapped fund into an interest 
bearing account which you have absolute control over in your country or 
a third country other than Nigeria.

The new civilian administration of Muhammadu BuharI (rtd) set-up this 
committee specifically to review all contracts/oil licenses to determine 
their propriety and relevance in the light of the country's current 
economic and political realities. We have identified a lot of inflated 
contract fund which are currently floating in our Apex Bank. At this 
moment we have worked out modalities withing ourselves and some 
acquaintances at the Apex Bank to divert the sum of US$93,700,000.00 
(Ninety three million, seven hundred thousand United States Dollars) 
only, for our personal use.

However, by virtue of our positions as Civil Servants and members of the 
Contract Review Panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names, 
consequently, I was delegated by my colleagues as a matter of trust to 
look for an overseas partner into whose account we can transfer this sum 
of money, hence this letter to you. Furthermore, my colleagues and I are 
willing to transfer the total sum of US$93,700,000.00 (Ninety three 
million, seven hundred thousand United States Dollars) into your account 
for disbursement. Your areas of specialization is not a hindrance to the 
successful execution of this transaction and the account required for 
this project can either be PERSONAL, COMPANY or an OFFSHORE account you 
have total control over. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at 
this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of 
this sum while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses between 
the parties in the course of this transaction. You must however note 
that this transaction is subject to the  following terms and 
conditions:-

(a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence
(b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality.
(c) That the funds would be transferred to an account where you have 
absolute control over.
(d) That one of our representatives will be with you in your country to 
represent our interest. This however depends on your response to 
conditions A and C above.

Modalities have been worked out to the highest level for the immediate 
transfer of the funds within 21 working days subject to your 
satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role 
is RISK FREE. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves and 
for mutual security of the funds, the whole approval procedures will be 
officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any 
company you may nominates as the bonafide beneficiary.

Once more, I want you to understand that having put over 23 years in the 
civil service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career 
dented. This matter should be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency.

Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include 
this transfer in this batch as payments to foreign contractors is 
usually carried out on quarterly basis. Contact me on my E-mail address:

From Mr. Allen Beneth

P.O. Box 20509 Atlanta, GA 30320

ATTENTION: I am Mr. Allen Beneth Head of Inspection Unit United   Nations   Inspection Agency in Harts field-Jackson International  Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered An  abandoned   shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was  transferred   from JF Kennedy Airport. To our facility here in 
Atlanta, and when  scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money  in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes  weighing approximately 242.508IBS each. The  consignment was abandoned   because the Content was not properly  declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal  Effect/classified document to  either avoid diversion by the Shipping 
Agent or confiscation by the  relevant authorities. The diplomat's  inability to pay for Non  Inspection fees among other things are the  reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. By my assessment,  each of the boxes contains  about $4M or more. They are still left in  the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like  I said  are two metal trunk boxesI need all the guarantee that I can get from  you before I can get   involved in this project. Please Reply this  email strictly at  (allenbent906@gmail.com) with reconfirmation of  your Full Name,  Home Address, City, State and Telephone number.

I am Mrs. Rebecca Samuel , I am a US citizen, 63 years Old. I reside here in New York. My residential address is as follows. Ditmars Blvd 77th Street, Queens NY 11370, United States, I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $97,500 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to no avail.

So I decided to travel to WASHINGTON D.C with all my compensation documents, And I was directed by the ( F B I) Director to contact Mr.Kelvin Williams, who his a representative of the ( F B I ) and a member of the COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE, currently in Nigeria. and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake.

He took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $2.5 Million Us Dollars Moreover, Mr. Kelvin Williams, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name as one of the beneficiaries, and your email address, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact Mr. Kelvin Williams.

You have to contact him directly with the below information.

COMPENSATION AWARD HOUSE
Name: Mr. Kelvin Williams
Email Address:  agentwilliams002@gmail.com 
Telephone Numbers:+234-816-517-6614

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in any way with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.The only money I paid after I met Mr. Kelvin Williams was just $220 for the paper works, take note of that.

Once again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact Mr. Kelvin Williams so that he can help you to deliver your fund instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank You and Be Blessed.

593, adrien.nepage.associates@gmx.com,THERE IS A GOOD NEWS ABOUT YOUR PAYMENT.,"


Dear Friend

I am so much worried all these while that you have not received your fund after several attempt and effort with some resources being voted  in.However,I have not given up effort for the actualization of your payment but my hands was tied up because of the constant problems  along the line.the format Today there is a good news about your payment,there is a seminar that took place last week here in Abuja the  capital of Nigeria  which involves some expatriate and it happens that I met one time course make when I was undergoing my masters degree who came from Britain,it happens that we lost contact for years but as God may do it she was among the entourage who came from Britain.

I had the opportunity of explaining to her the condition of your fund starting from day one because she is a notable lawyer in Britain and  works with Financial Conduct Authority in UK and their solicitor,the lady told me that it will be difficult for you to receive the fund  from Africa direct to your account/country because of high corruption and undeveloped financial practice in Africa, she advised me that the  best way you can be paid is that she will send an application to (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS NIGERIA) on behalf of Financial  Conduct Authority London and the fund will be directed to UK under the authority of FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY BACKED UP WITH UNITED  NATIONS as an entity. She said that this arrangement will not cost you money for your fund to be in UK with F.C.A and F.C.A  will immediately move the fund to you she said that no organization can ever interfere hence the Financial Conduct Authority is involved, so

I have forwarded all your information to the lawyer in London and she have been in contact with (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS  NIGERIA) the god news now is that the lawyer contacted me yesterday confirming to me that your fund is with Financial Conduct Authority in  London,but she said that she will contact you first before F.C.A .

Her information is:
Name: Barrister Adrienne Page.
Email:adrien.nepage.associates@gmx.com
Phone: +447452240165

Please wait for her email and let me know as soon as you hear from her by forwarding her message to me,I can give you 100% assurance that you will receive your fund this time so kindly work with her.You can equally send her message regarding to this update as you know that such lawyer may be so busy.

-- 
Dear Beloved Friend
Happy new year.

RE: THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN RECEIVING YOUR FUND

After waiting to hear from you or your Ghana partner for a long time 
now, I decided to make this direct approach to you as my new resolution 
in other not to let it be if I have anything in mind against you. I do 
not know if you have asked yourself why each time the release of this 
fund is approved, all of a sudden, the payment will be stopped or one 
problem or the other will come up if you have not asked this question or 
you do not know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.

Some time ago, your Ghanaian friends, I mean the people that introduced 
you to the project approached me through my dear wife who work with the 
Federal Ministry of Finance and requested me to assist them conclude a 
money transfer deal they had with you. They requested me to assist them 
by removing the original contractorâ€™s name, companyâ€™s name and bank 
particulars from the Bank Of Ghana vetting computer and replacing them 
with your name and bank details in order to make you appear as the 
rightful beneficiary of this fund.

I agreed on condition that they will pay me US$100,000.00 as soon as 
your name appears as the beneficiary. I did as agreed and demanded to be 
paid, but your friends started telling me stories, they even told me you 
promised to send money to me.

Do you know that up till now, I have not received a single cent from 
them and have not set my eyes on any of them?  Based on their attitude, 
I decided to stop the fund release movement because I cannot be denied 
of my right in my own office considering the risk as it might affect my 
job..  Secondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute 
any contract in Ghana, although I am the only person privileged to know 
this information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is 
that I can see that you are still making efforts in order to conclude 
this project. Now I am ready to forget the past.

I do not need the US $100.000.00 any longer from you but a good 
compensation from your mind. I need your assurance that those colleagues 
will be totally kept out of this transaction. I know that none of them 
is aware of my new approach to you. Stop spending your money

Good Day!

I am contacting you regarding a special cargo that has been abandoned here at our warehouse for over a period of 2 years and when scanned, it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in it. From my findings, the cargo originated from Europe and the content was not declared as money by the consignor in order to avoid diversion by the shipping agent. I strongly believe the box will contain about $7.5 million or more.

In my private search for a reliable person, my proposal now is to present you as the recipient of the cargo since the shipper has abandoned it which is a possibility due to the fact it has been abandoned for a period whereby a new beneficiary can be presented to the clearance department for claim and also my position at this shipping service. Alternatively, I can personally bring it myself and then we share the total money in the box equally.

             YOUR ABANDONED SHIPMENT/CARGO VALUE $8M

Dear owner

I am Mr. James Dee, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each.

The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.

By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more.They are still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 110kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name and email on the official document from United Nations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, full address so I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK (place of origin) as we were instructed.
(REPLY TO THIS EMAIL : (drjamesdee@gmail.com)

As I did say again, the shipAper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratification). You can either come in person or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the destination of your choice. I need all the guarantee that I can get from you before I can get involved in this project.

foreigner so that the proceeds of this account valued at about 
Nine Million Great British Pounds can be paid to you and then you

shall be for expenses or tax as your government may require. An

I have been a successful businessman for the past 20 years, my business interests has spanned the sectors of metals, oil and precious stones in Asia, Africa and Europe, during this time, I have amassed a lot of wealth but recently I was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. 

It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few weeks to live. I am very rich, but was never generous; I have given most of my assets to my immediate family members but my mind is not at peace since I have a dream of giving back to the society and helping the needy in our world.I have decided to give alms and donations to charity organizations.I cannot do this myself anymore because of my health. I once asked members of my family to give some money to charity
organizations,they refused and kept the money for themselves that made my health heavy and uneasy. 

I have a huge cash deposit in a secured bank since 2011. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations for charity work under your supervision.

You will take out 30% of these funds for your assistance. Please answer these questions(stevevalde@aol.com)

I am Mr Kennedy Thompson, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each.

The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.

By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more. They are still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 65kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name and email on the official document from United Nations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, full address so I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK  (place of origin) as we were instructed.(REPLY TO THIS EMAIL : (kennedy_thomspn1943@aol.com)

As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratification). You can either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the destination of your choice. I need all the guarantee that I can get from you before I can get involved in this project.

619, hassanusman703@gmail.com,RE: THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN RECEIVING YOUR FUND,"



-- 
Dear Beloved Friend
Happy new year.

RE: THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN RECEIVING YOUR FUND

After waiting to hear from you or your Ghana partner for a long time 
now, I decided to make this direct approach to you as my new resolution 
in other not to let it be if I have anything in mind against you. I do 
not know if you have asked yourself why each time the release of this 
fund is approved, all of a sudden, the payment will be stopped or one 
problem or the other will come up if you have not asked this question or 
you do not know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.

Some time ago, your Ghanaian friends, I mean the people that introduced 
you to the project approached me through my dear wife who work with the 
Federal Ministry of Finance and requested me to assist them conclude a 
money transfer deal they had with you. They requested me to assist them 
by removing the original contractorâ€™s name, companyâ€™s name and bank 
particulars from the Bank Of Ghana vetting computer and replacing them 
with your name and bank details in order to make you appear as the 
rightful beneficiary of this fund.

I agreed on condition that they will pay me US$100,000.00 as soon as 
your name appears as the beneficiary. I did as agreed and demanded to be 
paid, but your friends started telling me stories, they even told me you 
promised to send money to me.

Do you know that up till now, I have not received a single cent from 
them and have not set my eyes on any of them?  Based on their attitude, 
I decided to stop the fund release movement because I cannot be denied 
of my right in my own office considering the risk as it might affect my 
job..  Secondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute 
any contract in Ghana, although I am the only person privileged to know 
this information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is 
that I can see that you are still making efforts in order to conclude 
this project. Now I am ready to forget the past.

I do not need the US $100.000.00 any longer from you but a good 
compensation from your mind. I need your assurance that those colleagues 
will be totally kept out of this transaction. I know that none of them 
is aware of my new approach to you. Stop spending your money 
unnecessarily to Bank of Ghana Officers both here and overseas because 
you will not receive this money without my hand in it. I personally did 
the work at the beginning and only I can perform it. Finally,

I need your promise that no official of the Bank of Ghana will be aware 
of my involvement in this regard because of my position. Now re-assure 
me that you will be willing to compensate me and that you will assist my 
wife to establish a foreign account in your country where my 
compensation will be lodged.  Also a TT FUND RELEASE APPROVAL DOCUMENTS 
will be sent to you for endorsement after which I will remit the money 
within 48 hours.

I am a man of my word. If you are ready to conclude this business with 
me, kindly contact me on my mail so that we can have a chat over this 
issue once and for all.  But if the reverse is the case, do not bother 
yourself to reach me and forget about this money.

BEST REGARDS

Sometimes, I do wonder if you are really, really with your 
senses. How Could you keep trusting people and at the end you 
will loose your hard Earned money, or are you being deceived by 
their big names? They Impersonate on many offices, claiming to be 
Governors, Directors/Chairmen of one Office or the other. Their 
game plan is only just to extort your hard Earned money. Now, the 
question is how long you will continue to be Deceived? Sometimes, 
they will issue you fake check, introduce you to fake Diplomatic 
delivery, un-existing on-line banking and they will also fake 
wire transfer of Your fund with Payment Stop Order and even send 
you fake Atm cards etc.

Anyway, by the virtue of my position I have been following this 
Transaction from inception and all your efforts towards realizing 
the Fund. More often than not, I sit down and laugh at your 
ignorance and That of those who claim they are assisting you, it 
is very unfortunate That at the end you loose. Although, I don't 
blame you because you are Not here in Nigeria to witness the 
processing of your payment in Nigeria. The problem you are having 
is that you been told the whole truth About this transaction and 
it is because of this truth they decided to Be extorting your 
money. The most annoying part is even fraudsters Have really

expense. Those you feel are assisting or working for you are Your 
main problems. I know the truth surrounding this payment and I am 
The only person who will deliver you from this long suffering if 
you will abide by my advice.

They claim that they are helping you and you forward all the

nothing about the fraudsters. Soon they will ask you to pay money

money to them because they are only interested in your hard 
earned money and you will never receive any compensation in 
return, they will always keep coming back to ask for more money.

Please I beseech you to stop pursuit of shadows and being 
Deceived. Feel free to contact me immediately you receive this

release of your Payment. Do not panic, be rest assured that this

Hello Dear God,s Select Good Day,

I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears In my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, My Name is Mrs.Aileen Samih, and I am contacting you from my country Tunisia I want to tell you this because I don't have any other option than totell you as I was touched to open up to you, I married to Mr.samih habib. Who worked with Tunisia embassy in Burkina Faso for nine years before he died in the year 2005.We were married for eleven years without a child

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only five days. Since his death I decided not to remarry, When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$8.5m (Eight million And Five hundred Thousand Dollars) in a bank in Ouagadougou the capital city of Burkina Faso in west Africa Presently this money is still in bank. He made this money available for exportation of Gold from Burkina Faso mining.

Recently, My Doctor told me that I would not last for the period of seven months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I decided to hand you over this money to take care of the less-privileged people, you will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.

I want you to take 30 Percent of the total money for your personal use While 70% of the money will go to charity, people in the street and helping the orphanage. I grew up as an Orphan and I don't have any body as my family member, just to endeavour that the house of God is maintained. Am doing this so that God will forgive my sins and accept my soul because these sicknesses have suffered me so much.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank in Burkina Faso and I will also instruct the Bank Manager to issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of the money in the bank that is if you assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.

Always reply to my alternative for security purposes

Hoping to receive your reply:

Greetings to you! I am Mrs. Christy Walton, a citizen of the United States of America. I am a widow and a businesswoman. I bring to you a proposal worth the sum $14,900,000.00 (Million USD) which I intend to use for a humanitarian project. In June 2005, I inherited the sum of US$18.2 Billion from my late husband Mr. John T. Walton following his death in a plane crash.

I am happy to know you, I have never doubted my instinct as it has never failed me, even as it has directed me to you at this point in time so do not be afraid. I saw your e-mail contact at the department of commerce and foreign trade. I am writing this mail to you with heavy sorrow in my heart, it's painful to let you know that I have been suffering for esophageal cancer and a rare heart disease for the past 7 years and just a few weeks ago my Doctor told me that I won't survive the illness. I am contacting you because I don't have any other option but to open up to you about my project at hand. Please reply me back if you are interested so I can provide you with further details via: waltonchristy89@yahoo.com

I await your response.

My Dear Friend,

Greetings to you.

Please do not view my please a contrived plot.My trusted family attorney who would have executed my WILL &amp; TESTAMENT on my behalf died early this year after a brief illness.I therefore prayed fervently and by the special grace of GOD,i was led to you.I am Mrs.Mary Louis,from United Kingdom,I am 62 years old. I am suffering from cancer of the lungs and it has affected part of my brain cells due to complications.My condition is deteriorating and according to my doctors i may not be alive in the next couple of months,unless there is a divine intervention.

I was orphaned as a child and got married to late Engineer.Steve Louis for twenty years without having an offspring.My late husband had chronic cardiovascular condition and died of cardiac arrest few years ago.Steve and I lived in USA for over 18 years,where my husband a petrochemical engineer by profession worked and rose through the ranks and became an executive director in a multinational oil servicing and exploration conglomerate, before his untimely death.He also established huge private investments that i supervised before his death and which forms the major source of our fortune.

Consequent upon the shocking demise of my priceless husband, i opted as a rule, not to re-marry. When medical reports revealed that my cancer ailment have become terminal &amp; more so because i do not have a direct next of kin to bequeath all that STEVE &amp; I labored for,i sold off all our choice assets,landed properties and other valuable family treasures and deposited the proceeds amounting to USD$10,000,000.00 (TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONLY) with HSBC BANK IN UK. The management of the bank has written me as the sole beneficiary of the fund because of the unserviceable status of the fund over the years and suggested to me in a 2 paragraph statement to issue a letter of authorization to someone who can manage the fund on my behalf because of my terminal illness and also threatened that the fund could be confiscated upon my failure to adhere to their rules and regulations as clearly spelt out in their code of conduct.

I am on admission at the intensive care unit of a London hospital,located at Fulham road in west London United Kingdom. It is the leading cancer treatment hospital in the world.I am currently undergoing treatment there for late-stage terminal cancer of the lungs. I am computer literate, I rarely talk but has my personal laptop with me and has the permission of my physicians to use it,hence I am writing from my sick bed in the (ICU).It is my last WISH that 85% of this fund is invested substantially in any charitable organization of your choice and administered as you may deem fit,especially to the orphanage homes.You are at liberty to also donate part of the funds to churches and mosques and to those struck by natural disaster.I have earmarked 5% of the total fund to run cost of administration of WILL &amp; TESTAMENT and also on logistics and other sundry arrangements that you may require.

I crave your indulgence as a God fearing individual that equally has high moral pedestal and who is also an uncommon humanitarian that cares so much about the plight of the less-privileged as much as i do, to take it upon yourself and use this fund for the above mentioned purposes. This is a painstaking decision i have taken in other to help humanity in my little capacity as a people driven entrepreneur and a very God fearing woman before i bow to God's sovereignty.

Note that as soon as I receive your reply and personal information as listed below, I shall avail you with the official contact information of the HSBC BANK IN UK officials,to enable you contact the Bank without delays.I will also issue you with an official letter of authorization,so that my bankers will recognize your status as the new beneficiary of my ESTATE, FUND, WILL &amp; TESTAMENT. Interestingly 10% of the total sum is set aside as your compensation for accepting to play this significant role for me and i hope you will appreciate my kind gesture.

Let me remind you that the fund has an open beneficiary mandate and as such,it is whom i personally authorize or appoint to act on my behalf that the bank will ultimately recognize and release the funds to and by this memo,the onus has fallen on you to assume this selfless and noble responsibility that will catalyze change by exploring and promoting the development of new interventions that will benefit the poorest of the poor when the fund is transferred into your bank account.

Please assure me that you will not treat this offer with levity but will consciously yield my bequest continued existence.

Kindly send the information in this order:

(1) Your full names :============================= ======

(2) personal or official contact address:====================== =========

(3) Home or Office phone#:============Cellphone#: ==========Fax#:=======

(4) Your Age:===============

I Await your kind response while hoping you will appreciate my helpless predicament.

among the list of people who have never received any of their
payments among  lottery, inheritance, compensation and awarded
contract funds and victims who have lost a lot of money to

In view of the foregoing, a new payment of US$4.500,000.00 has

Dear Beneficiary

This letter is written to inform you the reason behind your delay payment.
I am Rev.Chris Amah the Director,International Remittance Department
of this Bank,my Formal Boss,Mr.Jacobs M.Ajekigbe,the Managing
Director/CEO of this bank is now on compulsory leave and all power
have been vested on me to make all international payments.Also,due to
reported cases of corrupt practices in other Nigeria Banks including
the Central Bank of Nigeria,the Federal Government has
revoked/canceled all power vested on those banks and has appointed our
bank (First Bank of Nigeria) to make all foreign payments.Be informed
that the Federal Government have approved the release of part-payment
of$7.5M(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) out of your total
funds,which has been in this bank for many years unclaimed because
Mr.Jacobs Ajekigbe,Collaborated with the Governor of Central
Bank of Nigeria (CBN)and have refused to tell you the truth on how to
claim your fund this is because he has been using the interest
accumulated from your fund every year to enrich himself without your
knowledge,I want to help you pull out this fund to your bank account
using the easiest and the quickest method,which have not been made
known to you before.By this method,you will open a domiciliary
account with this bank (First Bank of Nigeria),Where the fund would be
1st lodged into,before it can directly credit to any bank of your choice.
After the transfer,you will confirm the fund in your bank account
within 5hours the same day.No Cost of Transfer (COT) and no stoppage
from any Government departments as the transfer will be done within
the bank alone and it is very safe.The method which was introduced to
you before is the Telegraphic Transfer (TT) for which confirmation was
48hrs,because of the time factor,petitions could come from various
organizations stopping your payment and asking you to pay huge fee
which would be difficult for you to pay so that they can benefit from
the huge interest your fund generates while still in the Bank.
This method is not safe for you because it is not done within the bank
alone as information of the payment would be sent to the Central
Control Unit (CCU) of the Federal Ministry of Finance and office of
the Accountant General of the Federation.As a good Christian, I have
nothing to gain by keeping your fund,I want to assist you receive
your fund Before it accumulate Dumurrage.You have to follow up and

Hello Good Friend

                                          Your Abandoned Package For Delivery

I have very vital information to give to you, but first I must have your trust before I review it to you because it may cause me my job,so I need somebody that I can trust for me to be able to review the secret to you.

I am Mr.Todd M.Bowman, head of luggage/baggage storage facilities (Operations, Maintenance, Transportation) here at the Harrisburg International Airport, Pennsylvania USA. During my recent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from London and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 110kg. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as ""MONEY"" rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is $3,700USD. On my assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the Harrisburg International Airport Pennsylvania till date. The details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Trunk box.

However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of the Inspection Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance processes so as a result of this, I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address for quick processing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything concluded within 48 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.

Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to transact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment has not yet been returned to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share.

I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential. Please get back to me via my private Email:(offec55@gmail.com) for further directives.

Thanks,

hence I contacted you to stand as his next of kin. 


I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money in addition, 
property left behind by my client before they got Confiscated or

were lodged. Particularly, Lloyds Bank, where the deceased had an

Kin or have the account confiscated within the next twenty 
official working days. 


Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 
5 years now, I hereby seek your consent to present you as the 
next of kin to the deceased based on the fact that you are a 
foreigner so that the proceeds of this account valued at about 
Nine Million Great British Pounds can be paid to you and then you 
and I can share the money. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% 
shall be for expenses or tax as your government may require. An 
attorney shall be contracted to help re-validate and notarize all 
the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any 
claim we make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable 
us sees this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed 
under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any 
breach of the law.

I have very vital information to give to you, but first I must have your trust before I reveal it to you because it may cost me my job, so I need somebody that I can trust for me to be able to reveal the secret to you.

I am Charles J.Colocino JR, head of luggage/baggage storage facilities (Operations, Maintenance, and Transportation) here at the Harrisburg International Airport, Pennsylvania USA. During my recent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from London and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 110kg. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as ""MONEY"" rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is $3,700USD. On my assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the Harrisburg International Airport Pennsylvania till date.

The details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Trunk box. However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of the Inspection Unit, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance processes so as a result of this, I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address for quick processing and response.

Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything concluded within 48 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery. Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to transact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment has not yet been returned to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share.

I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential. Please get back to me via my private Email :( colcharlesj1@gmail.com ) for further directives.

Thanks,

Charles J.Colocino JR

Hello ,



My name is Sgt Major John Dailey. I am here in Afghanistan , I came
upon a project I think we can work together on. I and my partner (1st
Lt. Daniel Farkas ) have the sum of $15 Million United State Dollars
which we got from a Crude Oil Deal in Iraq before he was killed by an
explosion while on a Vehicle Patrol. Due to this incident, I want you
to receive these funds on my behalf as far as I can be assured that my
share will be safe in your care until I complete my service here in
Afghanistan and come over to meet with you. Since we are working here
for an Official capacity, I cannot keep these funds hence by
contacting you. I Guarantee and Assure you that this is risk free.



I just need your acceptance to help me receive these funds and all is
done. Since the death of my partner, my life is not guaranteed here
anymore, so I have decided to share these funds with you. I am also
offering you 40% of this money for the assistance you will give to me.
One passionate appeal I will make to you, is for you not to discuss
this matter with anybody, should you have reasons to reject this
offer, please and please destroy this message as any leakage of this
information will be too bad for us as soldiers here in Afghanistan. I
do not know how long we will remain here, and I have been shot,
wounded and survived so many suicide bomb attacks, this and other
reasons have prompted me to reach out to you for help. I honestly want
this matter to be resolved immediately, please contact me as soon as
possible on my e-mail address which is my only way of communication.



Yours In Service,
SGM John Dailey"
652, imfnigeria123@gmail.com,IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE EFCC,"

T, 3:49 PM
(wave)
Sometimes, I do wonder if you are really, really with your 
senses. How Could you keep trusting people and at the end you 
will loose your hard Earned money, or are you being deceived by 
their big names? They Impersonate on many offices, claiming to be 
Governors, Directors/Chairmen of one Office or the other. Their 
game plan is only just to extort your hard Earned money. Now, the 
question is how long you will continue to be Deceived? Sometimes, 
they will issue you fake check, introduce you to fake Diplomatic 
delivery, un-existing on-line banking and they will also fake 
wire transfer of Your fund with Payment Stop Order and even send 
you fake Atm cards etc.

Anyway, by the virtue of my position I have been following this 
Transaction from inception and all your efforts towards realizing 
the Fund. More often than not, I sit down and laugh at your 
ignorance and That of those who claim they are assisting you, it 
is very unfortunate That at the end you loose. Although, I don't 
blame you because you are Not here in Nigeria to witness the 
processing of your payment in Nigeria. The problem you are having 
is that you been told the whole truth About this transaction and 
it is because of this truth they decided to Be extorting your 
money. The most annoying part is even fraudsters Have really 
taken advantage of this opportunity to enrich them selves At your 
expense. Those you feel are assisting or working for you are Your 
main problems. I know the truth surrounding this payment and I am 
The only person who will deliver you from this long suffering if 
you will abide by my advice.

They claim that they are helping you and you forward all the 
fraudulent e-mails you receive to them. At the end they do 
nothing about the fraudsters. Soon they will ask you to pay money 
to receive a compensation of millions of dollars Do not pay any 
money to them because they are only interested in your hard 
earned money and you will never receive any compensation in 
return, they will always keep coming back to ask for more money.

Please I beseech you to stop pursuit of shadows and being 
Deceived. Feel free to contact me immediately you receive this 
mail so that I can Explain to you the modus-operandi guiding the 
release of your Payment. Do not panic, be rest assured that this 
arrangement will be Guided by your Embassy here in Nigeria.

N/B: You are urgently requested to provide me with the following 
information

Full Name:
Address:
Telephone Number:
Passport Or National Identity Copy:

Contact me upon the receipt of this mail if you wish to receive 
your fund and stop wasting your hard earn money..

657, jimbrowndavid7@gmail.com,SHIPMENT,"

Attention,

I am David Jim Brown, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 130kg.
The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.
By my assessment, each of the boxes contains $4M  which is total of $8Million USD. They are  still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two  metal trunk boxes weighing about 65kg each (Internal dimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name and email on the official document from United Nations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, full address so I  can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK
(place of origin) as we were instructed.

As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something  out of it (financial gratification). You can either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the  necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the  destination of your choice. I need all the guarantee that I can get from  you before I can get involved in this project.

Description of prize vehicle; Functions such as BMW Gesture Control, BMW Laserlight or Remote Control Parking again set benchmarks as pioneering innovations in the BMW X6 SUV. In addition,Superb comfort and support from the seats, which are well-suited to long-distance driving. The X6's suspension is tuned on the firm side, yet it's still capable of absorbing most road imperfections. From time to time, the ride gets choppy on rough pavement, but this is the exception and not the rule.The diesel-powered X6 xDrive35d model delivers the best combination of performance and efficiency.



The BMW X6 also extends the sheer driving pleasure typical of BMW to include the enjoyment of being driven. Passengers who occupy the luxurious seats in the rear enjoy a generous amount of space. While the active chassis technology of the Executive Drive Pro option offers a driving experience of unrestricted comfort and dynamism in every situation, the features of the ambient light design and innovative comfort and entertainment functions ensure a supreme level of relaxed travelling pleasure.



Each of the BMW TwinPower Turbo petrol and diesel engines of the BMW X6 is an expression of the dedicated development work of the BMW EfficientDynamics engineers. For overwhelming performance and ground-breaking efficiency. As a plug-in hybrid vehicle, the BMW X6 iPerformance with the BMW EfficientDynamics technology eDrive (BMW 740e/Le iPerformance) brings together the best of two worlds. The result is substantially lower fuel consumption with similarly reduced emissions.





The selection process was carried out through random selection in our computerized email selection system (ESS) from a database of over 250,000 email addresses drawn from all the continents of the world which you were selected.

Dear Friend,

My names are Mrs Linda Martin Lewis, I am a US citizen, i'm 43 years Old. I reside here in Clearwater Florida. My residential address is as follows, 912 Barry st 55rd Pl, Clearwater, Florida 32608-2112, United States. I'm thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that recently took part in the Compensation in Nigeria and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $90,750USD while in the United States trying to get my funds but all to no avail.

I was directed to meet Attorney Wayne Collins whom I explained everything that has happened to me. He made me to understand that i have been contacting the wrong people, and after i fellowed all his instructions on how i would get my funds and i trust in him after 1 week of working with him i was final paid my lost money of $4,500,000.00 (four million five hundred thousand dollars). 

Moreover, Attorney Wayne Collins showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name and email address as one of the beneficiaries that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people.

I will advise you to contact Attorney Wayne Collins You have to contact him directly on this information below.

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing. The only money I paid after I met the Attorney was just $435 for the delivery charges, please take note of that.

669, officedesk@qq.com,YOUR FUND.,"

Hello Beneficiary! 


I am calling you now to come up and claim back what you have lost to impostors/scammers. I cannot keep it further as my conscience reminds me of my duties as one who believes in equity and fair play, my name is Mrs. Rita Efiong, (personal adviser on international funds transfer to the executive governor of Central Bank of Nigeria). my fmr boss and some of his colleagues from several other ministries who are assigned with the duty of transferring your fund to you have conspired together to divert your fund to another account and the strategy they employed was by demanding several charges from you which you may have already paid some and left some unpaid, all the demands are illegal and intentionally designed to frustrate you to abandon your payment for them, they are currently working with fake finance minister, Attorney General of the Federation and some commercial bank chief executives in order to perfect their evil activities. He has counterparts in almost every country like United Kingdom, United States, 

As a matter of fact, (Mallam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi) the fmr Executive Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria CBN (now suspended) and his colleagues instructed me to change your payment details with the one they have just nominated for immediate transfer but i refused, note that they will frustrate you for ever if you continue dealing with them because they will never do the right thing since the quest for too much worldly gains has blinded their sense of reasoning, am in charge of crediting comptroller to infuse all those information but i am purposely delaying it as my mindset does not accept such evil.

I can release this fund to you if I am sure that I will be protected if not my life will be in danger? This money will be transferred to their private account if you further delay. If you are willing to get your payment direct into your account or through any other means, call or email me and reconfirm your account particulars and other related information's but if you chooses other legitimate ways let me know and forward your contact details to me immediately upon the receipt of this message.

At the receipt of this letter kindly call me or you forward your confidential cell phone number to me but don't expose this secret, even to those you are currently dealing with in respect of your payment both local and international and note that they are all agents working for the CBN fmr Executive Governor please stop communicating with them henceforth or you will remain frustrated in their cage, they have contacts all over the World but as far as i am concerned your payment will not be tampered with, but please Kindly consider this secret information as a top secret and highly privileged and should be kept till the end of time as having it divulged is a great risk on my side, if you're not interested do not bother to reply, otherwise your prompt response will do you a lot of good by having the right things done.

You should have asked why after all the series of fees you paid yet the transaction was still not concluded, it was a deliberate act to frustrate you out of the business.

Looking forward to your immediate response. For further clarifications, do not hesitate to contact my office.

Yours faithfully.

We have looked into the various claims and found out that TRUELY you have 
unclaimed funds indeed, most of wish initially originated from lottery 
winnings and donations by sick individuals. Your payment files from  
different banks; NatWest Bank of London, Central Bank of Nigeria and Benin 
Republic, Bank of America, Africa Development bank, UBA bank, E.T.C were 
compiled and submitted to my desk for review.. The total sum owed you is 
the tune of $28,850,000.00 Twenty Eight Million Eight Hundred and Fifty 
Thousand United States Dollars. As a matter of fact, this $28,850,000.00 is 
the ONLY funds that the government has approved and made available for your

have been approved worldwide by United Nations/World bank and IMF, of which 
the mandate to transfer has been gi

at this summit that the mandate to pay all compensations to scam victims, 
and other winning/inheritance/contract funds was given to the United Bank 
for Africa (UBA) New York Branch.

We also, after due scrutiny and verification, confirmed that you have 
attempted to fulfilling all the necessary obligations that will enable the 
release of your payment. Unfortunately, your payment was not released to 
you due to flimsy excuses from the Bank officials in charge of your 
payment, because they have the intention of diverting your funds to their

submission of your payment files to us so we can personally handle the

During our meeting with officials it was agreed that the only charges to be 
paid upfront in order to effect the transfer is $850.00, so you are advice 
to work together with the bank's general manager MR. UCHE IKE to ensure 
successful completion of your funds transfer. Know that all modalities 
regarding your funds release/transfer are in place there at the United Bank

672, attorneywcollins@yahoo.com,STOP CONTACTING THOSE SCAMMERS.,"

Dear Friend,

My names are Mrs Linda Martin Lewis, I am a US citizen, i'm 43 years Old. I reside here in Clearwater Florida. My residential address is as follows, 912 Barry st 55rd Pl, Clearwater, Florida 32608-2112, United States. I'm thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that recently took part in the Compensation in Nigeria and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $90,750USD while in the United States trying to get my funds but all to no avail.

I was directed to meet Attorney Wayne Collins whom I explained everything that has happened to me. He made me to understand that i have been contacting the wrong people, and after i fellowed all his instructions on how i would get my funds and i trust in him after 1 week of working with him i was final paid my lost money of $4,500,000.00 (four million five hundred thousand dollars). 

Moreover, Attorney Wayne Collins showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name and email address as one of the beneficiaries that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people.

I will advise you to contact Attorney Wayne Collins You have to contact him directly on this information below.

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing. The only money I paid after I met the Attorney was just $435 for the delivery charges, please take note of that.

I hope you heed to my advise.
Thank You and Remain Blessed.

Dearest One,

I hope my mail meet you in good condition of health? Dear I have decided to contact you after much thought considering the fact that we have not meet before, but because of some circumstance obliged me, I decided to contact you due to the urgency of my present situation here in the refugee camp for your rescue and also for a business venture/project which I need your assistant in this business establishment in your country as my foreign partner as well as my legal appointed trustee.

I am Aisha Muammar Gaddafi, the only daughter of the embattled president of Libya, Hon. Muammar Gaddafi. I am currently residing in Burkina Faso unfortunately as a refugee. I am writing this mail with tears and sorrow from my heart asking for your urgent help. I have passed through pains and sorrowful moment since the death of my late father.

At the meantime, my family is the target of Western nations led by Nato who wants to destroy my father at all costs. Our investments and bank accounts in several countries are their targets to freeze. My Father of blessed memory deposited the sum of $30.5M (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in a security firm in Europ which he used my name as the next of kin. I have been commissioned by Security Firm to present an interested foreign investor/partner who can stand as my trustee and receive the fund in his Name for a possible investment in his country due to my refugee status here in Burkina Faso.

I am in search of an honest and reliable person who will help me and stand as my trustee so that I will present him to the Security Firm for the transfer of the fund to his bank account overseas. I have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray my trust. But rather take me as your own sister or daughter. If this transaction interest you, you don't have to disclose it to anybody because of what my entire family is going through , if the united nation happens to know about this funds, they will freezing it as they froze others, so please keep this transaction only to yourself until we finalize it.

Apologetic for my pictures I will enclose it in my next mail and more about me when I hear from you. Please I want you to contact me for more information.

Thank and Best Regards,
Yours Sincerely,
Aisha Gaddafi.

Dear Winner,

This is to inform you that you have been selected for a prize of a Brand New 2018/19 BMW X6 SUV and a Cheque of $3,500,000.00USD from the international balloting programs held on the 2nd section in the UNITED STATE OF AMERICA.

Description of prize vehicle; Functions such as BMW Gesture Control, BMW Laserlight or Remote Control Parking again set benchmarks as pioneering innovations in the BMW X5 SUV. In addition,Superb comfort and support from the seats, which are well-suited to long-distance driving. The X5's suspension is tuned on the firm side, yet it's still capable of absorbing most road imperfections. From time to time, the ride gets choppy on rough pavement, but this is the exception and not the rule.The diesel-powered X5 xDrive35d model delivers the best combination of performance and efficiency.

The BMW X5 also extends the sheer driving pleasure typical of BMW to include the enjoyment of being driven. Passengers who occupy the luxurious seats in the rear enjoy a generous amount of space. While the active chassis technology of the Executive Drive Pro option offers a driving experience of unrestricted comfort and dynamism in every situation, the features of the ambient light design and innovative comfort and entertainment functions ensure a supreme level of relaxed travelling pleasure.

Each of the BMW TwinPower Turbo petrol and diesel engines of the BMW X5 is an expression of the dedicated development work of the BMW EfficientDynamics engineers. For overwhelming performance and ground-breaking efficiency.

686, clarkedwin388@gmail.com,LET ME HEAR FROM YOU,"

Dear Friend,


It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a surprise.This is because
we have not met before but I am inspired to sending you  this email following
the huge fund transfer opportunity that will be of  mutual benefit to the two
of us.

However, I am Edwin Clark, working as account record to the late Engineer.  

A National of your Country with companies in the UK.
On the  20th of November,2012. My client,his wife And their two children were
involved  in a car accident along Old Broad Street drive Express Way,London.
Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident.

Since then I have made several inquiries to several embassies to locate
any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his
relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no
avail,but fortunately his last name matches yours,hence I contacted you to
assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client,I can
easily convince the bank with being an insider in the bank and having all his
records you are the only surviving relation of my client.

Since I have most of his legal documents with me as his personal account officer
Otherwise the estate he left behind will be confiscated or declared
non serviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were
lodged.Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at
about USD17,000,000(Seventeen Million USD).
Consequently,The bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or
have the account confiscated within the next 21 official working days.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over several
years now.I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the
deceased,so that the proceeds of this account valued at $21,000,000.00 USD
can be paid to your account and then you and me can share the money.
45% for me and 45% for you 10% for taxes your government may require.

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal.
This deal is 100% risk free as an insider in the bank I will use my office to
provide the legal documents to authenticate your status as the bona fide next
of kin and no one will ever come for claim.
If you are interested kindly send me the below details to enable me begin the
process.

Your Full Name:
Present Address:
Mobile Number:
Your Occupation:

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that
will protect you from any breach of law.


Sincerely,
Edwin Clark.

Dear Beneficiary,



Series of meetings have been held over the past 7 months with the secretary general of the United Nations Organization. This ended 3 days ago. It is obvious that you have not received your fund which is to the tune of Eight Million and Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars ($8,500,000.00) due to past corrupt Governmental Officials who almost held the fund to themselves for their selfish reason and some individuals who have taken advantage of your fund all in an attempt to swindle your fund which has led to so many losses from your end and unnecessary delay in the receipt of your fund.



The National Central Bureau of Interpol enhanced by the United Nations and Federal Bureau of Investigation have successfully passed a mandate to the current president of United States Of America his Excellency President Donald J. Trump to boost the exercise of clearing all foreign debts owed to you and other individuals and organizations who have been found not to have receive their Contract Sum, Lottery/Gambling, Inheritance and the likes. Now how would you like to receive your payment? Because we have two method of payment which is by Check or by ATM card?



ATM Card: We will be issuing you a custom pin based ATM card which you will use to withdraw up to $3,000 per day from any ATM machine that has the Master Card Logo on it and the card have to be renewed in 4 years time which is 2020. Also with the ATM card you will be able to transfer your funds to your local bank account. The ATM card comes with a handbook or manual to enlighten you about how to use it. Even if you do not have a bank account.



Check: To be deposited in your bank for it to be cleared within three working days. Your payment would be sent to you via any of your preferred option and would be mailed to you via DHL. Because we have signed a contract with DHL which should expire in next three weeks you will only need to pay $310 instead of $600 saving you $290. So if you pay before the three weeks you save $290 Take note that anyone asking you for some kind of money above the usual fee is definitely a fraudsters and you will have to stop communication with every other person if you have been in contact with any.


DO NOT SEND MONEY TO ANYONE UNTIL YOU READ THIS: The actual fees for shipping your ATM card is $600 but because DHL have temporarily discontinued the C.O.D which gives you the chance to pay when package is delivered for international shipping We had to sign contract with them for bulk shipping which makes the fees reduce from the actual fee of $600 to $310 nothing more and no hidden fees of any sort!Note: Everything has been taken care of by the Federal Government, The United Nation and also the FBI and including taxes, custom paper and clearance duty so all you will ever need to pay is $310.

Good day,

I am Mrs. Deena Briggs, a US citizen, Am 42 years old. I am one of those people that took part in receiving Inheritance funds and Lottery funds from European banks even from many lottery organizers few years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid different fees while in the United States trying to get my funds from those banks and lottery organizers but all to no avail. So I decided to travel to West Africa (Nigeria) with all my compensation documents, and I was directed by the IMF Director to contact one Rev Albert Malachi who is the head department officer of the Compensation Award Office, Rev Albert Malachi his British citizen and a member of the UNITED NATIONS &amp; IMF COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE currently working with IMF and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake. Rev Albert Malachi personally directed me on how to claim my Inheritance or Lottery payment.


Right now I have received my compensation funds of $1.2 Million Dollars, Moreover, Rev Albert Malachi is a very religious man with the fear of God. He showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their Inheritance or Lottery payment and I saw your name as one of the beneficiaries, and your email address, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you.

I will personally advise you to contact Rev Albert Malachi with your FULL NAME, FULL ADDRESS, TELEPHONE NUMBER, OCCUPATION, AGE, SEX, he will assist you once  he get the listed information you are to provide.

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing. NOTE: The only money I paid after I met Rev Albert Malachi was just $470 USD for the Endorsement and clearance fee, take note of that.

Thank You and Be Blessed.

World Bank, Barclays Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, British High Commission 
E.T.C

We are working round the clock to get hold of these individuals who in one 
way or the other, masterminds the use of banks, courier service and 
embassies while posing as the real persons to extort money from their 
victims. You are WARNED to STOP further communication either by phone or 
email to any of this person listed above or any other person posing as an 
agent. And we urge you to forward any email you receive to this office for 
verification and approval before you reply them.

We have looked into the various claims and found out that TRUELY you have 
unclaimed funds indeed, most of wish initially originated from lottery 
winnings and donations by sick individuals. Your payment files from  
different banks; NatWest Bank of London, Central Bank of Nigeria and Benin 
Republic, Bank of America, Africa Development bank, UBA bank, E.T.C were 
compiled and submitted to my desk for review.. The total sum owed you is 
the tune of $28,850,000.00 Twenty Eight Million Eight Hundred and Fifty 
Thousand United States Dollars. As a matter of fact, this $28,850,000.00 is 
the ONLY funds that the government has approved and made available for your 
immediate action. The funds are lodged into the United Bank for Africa 
(UBA) New York Branch Office, while waiting for accreditation and transfer 
to your personal/private bank account in any part of the world. The funds 
have been approved worldwide by United Nations/World bank and IMF, of which 
the mandate to transfer has been gi
 ven to the United Bank for Africa

The choice of United Bank for Africa (UBA) New York Branch was made during 
the general assembly of African heads of States at Addis Ababa, 22 January 
2018, the summit was tagged ""Winning The Fight Against Corruption"". It was 
at this summit that the mandate to pay all compensations to scam victims, 
and other winning/inheritance/contract funds was given to the United Bank 
for Africa (UBA) New York Branch.

We also, after due scrutiny and verification, confirmed that you have 
attempted to fulfilling all the necessary obligations that will enable the 
release of your payment. Unfortunately, your payment was not released to 
you due to flimsy excuses from the Bank officials in charge of your 
payment, because they have the intention of diverting your funds to their 
private accounts in order to satisfy their selfish interest. You are 
however lucky that we detected their evil plans and therefore call for the 
submission of your payment files to us so we can personally handle the 
payment assignment to ensure that you receive your funds accordingly.


During our meeting with officials it was agreed that the only charges to be 
paid upfront in order to effect the transfer is $850.00, so you are advice 
to work together with the bank's general manager MR. UCHE IKE to ensure 
successful completion of your funds transfer. Know that all modalities 
regarding your funds release/transfer are in place there at the United Bank 
for Africa (UBA) New York Branch, so the only obligation you are to fulfill 
now in order to receive your $28,850,000.00 payment is to contact UCHE IKE 
the General manager United Bank for Africa (UBA) New York Branch with your 
full details and request for the funds transfer and pay the transaction 
fees of $850.00

You are to contact UCHE IKE the General manager United Bank for Africa 
(UBA) New York Branch  by email/phone with the below information and make 
sure you forward your information to him such as full name, address and 
direct telephone number.

Dear Friend,
I am Mr david kola Lucas, a merchant in the Middle East.But based in 
london
uk I
have been diagnosed with Cancer which was discovered very late, due to 
my
laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, 
Right
now I have only about a few months to live, according to my Medical 
Doctor.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared 
for
myself but the oil business. Though, I am very rich, I was never ge!
nerous, I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared
for.
But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than
just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when 
God
gives me a second chance and heal me I would live my life a different 
way
from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my healing I have 
willed
and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended
family members and as well as a few close friends. I want God to be
merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to
charity organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged 
of
the Tsunami Victims and the Huricane katrina in USA, as I want this to 
be
one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed 
money
to some charity organizations in India and Malaysia. Now that my health 
has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this mys! Elf anymore.
I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts in Saudi 
Bank
and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and 
to
the less privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan-Africa They cashed the money 
but
kept it only to themselves.Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they 
seem
not to be contended with what I have left for them already. The last of 
my
money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $4, million that 
I
have in the Vault of a security house in uk for safe keeping. I want you 
to
collect this deposit on my behalf and disburse half of it to the 
Huricane
Katrina in USA as well as Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia for the 
less
privileged (for charity purpose) and the other half to set up an 
investment
that is profit base in other to keep the charity work alive.
Please send me a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in this
disbursement. For your willingness and readiness to act accor! dingly, I
will set aside 40% for you for your time and efforts in caring out this
responsibility on my behalf while,the remaining 60% will be used by you 
for
both charity work and setting up of an investment that is profit 
oriented
to enable you continue to assist the less privileged from time to time 
from
the profit you make from this investment annually. I need your urgent 
reply
so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible person to 
handle
this project. I look forward to hear from you soon.ALWAYS REPLY TO ME
HERE,,,,davidkola300@gmail.com
God bless you.

She said that this arrangement will not cost you money for your fund to be in UK with F.C.A and F.C.A  will immediately move the fund to you she said that no organization can ever interfere hence the Financial Conduct Authority is involved, so

Dear Friend,

It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a surprise. This  
is because we have not met before but I am inspired to send you this  
email of this huge fund transfer opportunity that will be of mutual  
benefit to both of us.

Firstly, let me start by introducing myself properly. I am Gedeon  
Houssou, credit officer; TRUST FINANCIAL COMPANY here in Cotonou. I  
hope you will not betray this trust I want to have in you.

One Late Libyian, An Iron Steel Company Chairman with the Federal  
Government here in Benin until his death some years ago in an Auto  
Crash Deposited with us some amount of money amounting $14,000,000  
(Fourteen million United States Dollars), the company now expects a  
next of kin as beneficiary of this deposit. Valuable efforts have been  
made by TRUST FINANCIAL COMPANY to get in touch with any of the late  
beneficiary family or relatives but to no avail.

Because of the perceived possibilities of not going to be able to  
locate any of the Late beneficiary next of kin, the management under  
the leadership of our chairman and members of the board of directors  
have made arrangements to declare the fund not claimable and therefore  
be used to import ammunition's into our country.

However, in order to avert this negative development, some of my  
trusted colleagues and I now seek the consent and involvement of a  
trusted person who we can present as next of kin to the Late  
beneficiary so that the fund (US$14,000,000)  will be released and  
transferred into the persons account as the beneficiary.

All documents and proofs to enable you get this fund have been  
carefully worked out. We have secured from the probate, an order of  
mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries, and more so, we  
are assuring you that this business is 100% risk free involvement.  
Your share remains while the rest will be shared amongst myself and my  
colleagues for investment purposes anywhere according to agreement  
between us and yourself.

So, as soon as we receive an acknowledgment of the receipt of this our  
mutual business proposal from you, we would furnish you with the  
necessary disbursement ratio to suite both parties. If this proposal  
is acceptable by you, do not hesitate to contact me through my private  
e-mail : gedoenhnet@gmail.com

Looking forward to your urgent response.

Best regards,
  Gedeon.

Our principle of cooperation is to ""work together to grow and achieve win-win results"".
Partner requirements of joint venture:
1,  Provide workshop:5000-8000 square meter workshop at least,and over 15000-24000 square meters land.

Good Day,
My name is Mrs. Irene Shawcross; I am a dying woman who had decided to
donate what I have to the Charities based on the instructions given to 
me by my late husband Mr. Shaw. I am 70 years old and was diagnosed with 
cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death of my husband 
who was Marine engineer and a contractor from governmental tenders and 
other private entities, my late husband died accidentally under one of 
the heavy duty equipment at one of his construction sites, We had not a 
single child of our own to count on, We have been touched to donate from 
what I have inherited from my late husband for the good work rather than 
allow his relatives to varnish my husband's hard earned fund, although 
they have already looted and taken a lot. My health will not permit me 
to carry out some of the things, each day that passes by, I am afraid to 
die, but life gives me no choice, but to answer the call.

I managed to get your contact details online in my desperate search for 
a trustworthy person to assist me in this transaction, and he or she  
will also benefit financially. Recently, the doctors told me I might not 
live longer than 3 months after they diagnosed me of chronic/acute 
lymphoma or myelitis [leukemia]. Leukemia is a blood cancer in both the 
bone marrow and in blood itself, leukemia cells crowd out normal blood 
cells leading to serious bleeding and infection. I have been undergoing 
blood transfusion and it has drained My purse and little savings in my 
hand although I belong to the high and rich, but feed like a person who 
has nothing, as a result of this sickness. I want you to help me in 
carrying out my last wish on earth which will be very profitable to us. 
I want to WILL/Donate to you the total sum of $30.5 million USDollars 
(Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) to you which I want 
you to distribute part of it to any charity home for me in your country 
and the rest for yourself and your family which I will inform you on how 
to share all as part of instructions from my late husband before his 
death;
please for further information contact me ASAP. Please reply as quickly 
as you can, based on the fact that this is very urgent. You can also 
call me if you can, although I am in and out the hospital for treatment, 
but once the hospital gives me chance to use my phone I will answer your 
call.

this amount results from a deliberate inflation of the value of a contract awarded by our ministry - the federal ministry of agriculture (fma)to an expatriate company.the contract has been executed and payment made to the original contractor,remaining the over-invoiced amount of us$35.5 million,which we want to transfer the funds out the country in our favour for disbursement among ourselves.the transfer of this money can only be possible with the help of a foreigner who will be presented as the beneficiary of the fund.

as government officials, we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts,and this is the reason why we decided to contact you. we have agreed that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of this fund (us$35,500,000.00 million)25% of the total sum will be for you for providing the account while 5% will be set aside for the expenses incurred during the cost of transfer of the fund into your account while 70% will be reserved for us.

we hereby solicit for your assistance in providing a convenient account number in a designated bank abroad where this fund would be transferred.we intend coming over there on the completion of this transfer to secure our own share of the money.

please note that we have been careful and have made all arrangements towards the success and smooth transfer of the fund to your account before  you. for security reasons and confidentiality of this transaction, we demand that you should not expose this proposal and the entire transaction to anybody.

note:our former president Dr.Good luck Ebele Jonathan collaborated with  the former chairman of the economic financial crime commission ,Chief (Mrs.) Farida Mzamber Waziri  to stop the junior ranks officers from transferring funds out  of the country. he sent different publication to many countries in the world as propaganda to discourage all government officials from transferring funds into an overseas account to avoid and save guides the countries economy.

apparently, so that other government officials will not benefits from these( oil windfalls venture) where he has been a culprit alone with his aides.more details about this transaction will be given to you as soon as we receive your positive respond.

Good Day,
My name is Mrs. Irene Shawcross; I am a dying woman who had decided to
donate what I have to the Charities based on the instructions given to 
me by my late husband Mr. Shaw. I am 70 years old and was diagnosed with 
cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death of my husband 
who was Marine engineer and a contractor from governmental tenders and 
other private entities, my late husband died accidentally under one of 
the heavy duty equipment at one of his construction sites, We had not a 
single child of our own to count on, We have been touched to donate from 
what I have inherited from my late husband for the good work rather than 
allow his relatives to varnish my husband's hard earned fund, although 
they have already looted and taken a lot. My health will not permit me 
to carry out some of the things, each day that passes by, I am afraid to 
die, but life gives me no choice, but to answer the call.

I managed to get your contact details online in my desperate search for 
a trustworthy person to assist me in this transaction, and he or she  
will also benefit financially. Recently, the doctors told me I might not 
live longer than 3 months after they diagnosed me of chronic/acute 
lymphoma or myelitis [leukemia]. Leukemia is a blood cancer in both the 
bone marrow and in blood itself, leukemia cells crowd out normal blood 
cells leading to serious bleeding and infection. I have been undergoing 
blood transfusion and it has drained My purse and little savings in my 
hand although I belong to the high and rich, but feed like a person who 
has nothing, as a result of this sickness. I want you to help me in 
carrying out my last wish on earth which will be very profitable to us. 
I want to WILL/Donate to you the total sum of $30.5 million USDollars 
(Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) to you which I want 
you to distribute part of it to any charity home for me in your country 
and the rest for yourself and your family which I will inform you on how 
to share all as part of instructions from my late husband before his 
death; You will get 20% of the fund as your compensation for helping me 
and my late husband to fulfill the project.
please for further information contact me ASAP. Please reply as quickly 
as you can, based on the fact that this is very urgent. You can also 
call me if you can, although I am in and out the hospital for treatment, 
but once the hospital gives me chance to use my phone I will answer your 
call.
Here is my Direct email address ( irshawcross@gmail.com  ) .
Phone: No  +27-79-4405094

Bank of AMERICA, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, Interpol, EFCC, 
World Bank, Barclays Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, British High Commission 
E.T.C

We are working round the clock to get hold of these individuals who in one 
way or the other, masterminds the use of banks, courier service and 
embassies while posing as the real persons to extort money from their 
victims. You are WARNED to STOP further communication either by phone or 
email to any of this person listed above or any other person posing as an 
agent. And we urge you to forward any email you receive to this office for 
verification and approval before you reply them.

We have looked into the various claims and found out that TRUELY you have 
unclaimed funds indeed, most of wish initially originated from lottery 
winnings and donations by sick individuals. Your payment files from  
different banks; NatWest Bank of London, Central Bank of Nigeria and Benin 
Republic, Bank of America, Africa Development bank, UBA bank, E.T.C were 
compiled and submitted to my desk for review.. The total sum owed you is 
the tune of $28,850,000.00 Twenty Eight Million Eight Hundred and Fifty 
Thousand United States Dollars. As a matter of fact, this $28,850,000.00 is 
the ONLY funds that the government has approved and made available for your 
immediate action. The funds are lodged into the United Bank for Africa 
(UBA) New York Branch Office, while waiting for accreditation and transfer 
to your personal/private bank account in any part of the world. The funds 
have been approved worldwide by United Nations/World bank and IMF, of which 
the mandate to transfer has been gi
 ven to the United Bank for Africa

The choice of United Bank for Africa (UBA) New York Branch was made during 
the general assembly of African heads of States at Addis Ababa, 22 January 
2018, the summit was tagged ""Winning The Fight Against Corruption"". It was 
at this summit that the mandate to pay all compensations to scam victims, 
and other winning/inheritance/contract funds was given to the United Bank 
for Africa (UBA) New York Branch.

We also, after due scrutiny and verification, confirmed that you have 
attempted to fulfilling all the necessary obligations that will enable the 
release of your payment. Unfortunately, your payment was not released to 
you due to flimsy excuses from the Bank officials in charge of your 
payment, because they have the intention of diverting your funds to their 
private accounts in order to satisfy their selfish interest. You are 
however lucky that we detected their evil plans and therefore call for the 
submission of your payment files to us so we can personally handle the 
payment assignment to ensure that you receive your funds accordingly.


During our meeting with officials it was agreed that the only charges to be 
paid upfront in order to effect the transfer is $850.00, so you are advice 
to work together with the bank's general manager MR. UCHE IKE to ensure 
successful completion of your funds transfer. Know that all modalities 
regarding your funds release/transfer are in place there at the United Bank 
for Africa (UBA) New York Branch, so the only obligation you are to fulfill 
now in order to receive your $28,850,000.00 payment is to contact UCHE IKE 
the General manager United Bank for Africa (UBA) New York Branch with your 
full details and request for the funds transfer and pay the transaction 
fees of $850.00

You are to contact UCHE IKE the General manager United Bank for Africa 
(UBA) New York Branch  by email/phone with the below information and make 
sure you forward your information to him such as full name, address and 
direct telephone number.

Dear Respectfully,

In my long years of work with top financial management companies in the United Kingdom, l and my Partner Mr. Hernandez have earned the confidence of most our high net-worth clients. I presently have two clients (Non Europeans) who have funds to give out for investment either on equity or loan basis.

The areas to be considered for the investment are as follows Real estate, Oil &amp; Gas, Agriculture, Health, Aviation, Tourism, Retail, Construction, IT &amp; Communications, Technology, Education, Energy, Engineering, Utilities, Telecoms, Mining, Maritime, sustainable energy and host of other profitable ventures.

Intending beneficiaries must have a business plan and show their capability to manage huge funds. The beneficiary must be able to deliver good and sustainable returns on investment to the investor annually. If you are that person or establishment seeking to expand your existing business or you have new ideas waiting for implementation, the opportunity is here.

Moreover, Attorney Wayne Collins showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name and email address as one of the beneficiaries that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people.

749, imfnigeria123@gmail.com,IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE EFCC,"



Sometimes, I do wonder if you are really, really with your 
senses. How Could you keep trusting people and at the end you 
will loose your hard Earned money, or are you being deceived by 
their big names? They Impersonate on many offices, claiming to be 
Governors, Directors/Chairmen of one Office or the other. Their 
game plan is only just to extort your hard Earned money. Now, the 
question is how long you will continue to be Deceived? Sometimes, 
they will issue you fake check, introduce you to fake Diplomatic 
delivery, un-existing on-line banking and they will also fake 
wire transfer of Your fund with Payment Stop Order and even send 
you fake Atm cards etc.

Anyway, by the virtue of my position I have been following this 
Transaction from inception and all your efforts towards realizing 
the Fund. More often than not, I sit down and laugh at your 
ignorance and That of those who claim they are assisting you, it 
is very unfortunate That at the end you loose. Although, I don't 
blame you because you are Not here in Nigeria to witness the 
processing of your payment in Nigeria. The problem you are having 
is that you been told the whole truth About this transaction and 
it is because of this truth they decided to Be extorting your 
money. The most annoying part is even fraudsters Have really 
taken advantage of this opportunity to enrich them selves At your 
expense. Those you feel are assisting or working for you are Your 
main problems. I know the truth surrounding this payment and I am 
The only person who will deliver you from this long suffering if 
you will abide by my advice.

They claim that they are helping you and you forward all the 
fraudulent e-mails you receive to them. At the end they do 
nothing about the fraudsters. Soon they will ask you to pay money 
to receive a compensation of millions of dollars Do not pay any 
money to them because they are only interested in your hard 
earned money and you will never receive any compensation in 
return, they will always keep coming back to ask for more money.

Please I beseech you to stop pursuit of shadows and being 
Deceived. Feel free to contact me immediately you receive this 
mail so that I can Explain to you the modus-operandi guiding the 
release of your Payment. Do not panic, be rest assured that this 
arrangement will be Guided by your Embassy here in Nigeria.

756, miss.susan.smith19@gmail.com,Can you honestly help me from your heart?,"

Good day dear,

 I am the only Daughter of my late parents Mr. and Mrs. Nelson Smith.
My father was a highly reputable business magnet who operated in the
capital of Tunisia during his days.

It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one
of his business trips abroad on the 12th September 2015. Though his
sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded
by an uncle of mine who traveled with him that same day. But God knows
the truth! My mother died when I was just 6yrs old, and since then my
father took me so special.

Before his death on September 2015, he called me and informed me that
he has the sum of Five Million, Seven Hundred thousand United State
Dollars.(USD$5,700,000.00) left in fixed deposit account in one of the
leading banks in Africa.

He further told me that he deposited the money in my name, and also
gave me all the necessary but legal documents to this fund with the
bank. I am just 18 years old and a university undergraduate and really
don't know what to do.

Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds and
after the transaction I will come and reside permanently in your
country till such a time that will be convenience for me to return
back home if I so desire. This is because I have suffered a lot of set
backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast.

The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I also want
to invest the fund under your care because I am ignorant of business
world.

I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.
Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to
ask these
few questions:

  1. Can you honestly help me from your heart?
  2. Can I completely trust you?
  3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for
you after the money is in your account?

Please, consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.

Kind Regards,
Miss. Susan Smith

-- 
My name is Barr. Jose Pedro Perez-Llorca , a legal practitioner in 
Madrid Spain. I have a business proposal which i believe that will be a 
very good opportunity for both of us so I decided to contact you on this 
business opportunity here in Spain.

The proposal is that I have a client, who was deceased since 2000, 
alongside with his entire family in Air France,you can confirm it 
yourself via the website below from BBC NEWS: click on the link for more 
information or confirmation ( 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/859479.stm ). I am contacting you to 
know if you could help or assist me in claiming of the funds that was 
left in my deceased client's bank account in Spain. So, I have decided 
to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as 
the next of kin to the deceased since nobody is coming for it and I 
donâ€™t want this money to go into the banks treasury as unclaimed funds 
or declared to the Government of Spain, once this is done the Government 
of Spain will confiscate the funds, which is not good for both of us. I 
agreed that 40 % of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in 
respect to your acceptance to do this business with me, while 60% would 
be for me and my family. The total amount of cash in the bank account of 
my deceased client is â‚¬24,700,000 (Twenty Four Million, Seven Hundred 
Thousand Euros Only).

The bank have issued to me a notification to contact the next of kin of 
my deceased client for either to re-activate the bank account or to make 
claim of beneficiary of the Money in the bank account, with a month 
surcharge of 6% to be deducted as an Escrow safe keeping fee of the bank 
account, so as to avoid the indefinite closure of the bank account. I 
want to seek your consent first and to present your kind self as the 
next of kin and beneficiary of my deceased client, since I have the 
whole informationâ€™s that the bank will request for the release of the 
fund.
This means that the proceeds of his bank account would be paid to you as 
his next of kin or the legitimate beneficiary. When the money is been 
transferred into your account, I will visit your country to set up an 
investment under your kind control. All the legal documents to back up 
your claim as my client's next of kin would be provided by me. The most 
important thing I want is your honest co-operation in this proposition. 
This would be done under a legitimate arrangement that would protect you 
from any breach of the law.

If this business proposition offends your moral and ethical values, feel 
free to back out. Please contact me at once if you are interested.

761, adrien.nepage.associates@gmx.com,THERE IS A GOOD NEWS ABOUT YOUR PAYMENT.,"

Dear Friend

I am so much worried all these while that you have not received your fund after several attempt and effort with some resources being voted  in.However,I have not given up effort for the actualization of your payment but my hands was tied up because of the constant problems  along the line.the format Today there is a good news about your payment,there is a seminar that took place last week here in Abuja the  capital of Nigeria  which involves some expatriate and it happens that I met one time course make when I was undergoing my masters degree who came from Britain,it happens that we lost contact for years but as God may do it she was among the entourage who came from Britain.

I had the opportunity of explaining to her the condition of your fund starting from day one because she is a notable lawyer in Britain and  works with Financial Conduct Authority in UK and their solicitor,the lady told me that it will be difficult for you to receive the fund  from Africa direct to your account/country because of high corruption and undeveloped financial practice in Africa, she advised me that the  best way you can be paid is that she will send an application to (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS NIGERIA) on behalf of Financial  Conduct Authority London and the fund will be directed to UK under the authority of FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY BACKED UP WITH UNITED  NATIONS as an entity. She said that this arrangement will not cost you money for your fund to be in UK with F.C.A and F.C.A  will immediately move the fund to you she said that no organization can ever interfere hence the Financial Conduct Authority is involved, so

I have forwarded all your information to the lawyer in London and she have been in contact with (AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LAGOS  NIGERIA) the god news now is that the lawyer contacted me yesterday confirming to me that your fund is with Financial Conduct Authority in  London,but she said that she will contact you first before F.C.A .

Her information is:
Name: Barrister Adrienne Page.
Email: adrien.nepage.associates@gmx.com
Phone: +447452240165

Please wait for her email and let me know as soon as you hear from her by forwarding her message to me,I can give you 100% assurance that you will receive your fund this time so kindly work with her.You can equally send her message regarding to this update as you know that such lawyer may be so busy.

Dear good friend,

I am happy to know you, but God knows you better and he knows why he has
directed me to you at this point, so do not be afraid. Calvary Greetings in
the name of the LORD Almighty and Our LORD JESUS CHRIST the giver of every
good thing. Good day and compliments of the seasons, i know this letter
will definitely come to you as a huge surprise, but I implore you to take
the time to go through it carefully as the decision you make will go off a
long way to determine my future and continued existence. I am Mrs. Kaya
Fontane aging widow of 68 years old suffering from long time illness. I
have some funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum of (24.6Million
Dollars) and I needed a very honest and God fearing  who can withdraw this
money then use the funds for Charity works. I WISH TO GIVE THIS FUNDS TO
YOU FOR CHARITY WORKS. I found your email address from the internet after
honest prayers  to the LORD to bring me a helper and i decided to contact
you if you may be willing and interested to handle these trust funds in
good faith before anything happens to me. This money is still with them and
the management just wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive
the money for keeping it so long or rather issue a letter of authorization
to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I can not come over because of
my illness or they get it confiscated. Presently, I'm with my laptop in a
hospital here in where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer of the
lungs.

I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit
this money after I die. I want your urgent reply to me so that I will give
you the deposit receipt which the  COMPANY issued to me as next of kin for
immediate transfer of the money to your account in your country, to start
the good work of God, I want you to use the 40/percent of the total amount
to help yourself in doing the project. I am desperately in keen need of
assistance and I have summoned up courage to contact you for this task, you
must not fail me and the millions of the poor people in our todays WORLD.
This is no stolen money and there are no dangers involved,100% RISK FREE
with full legal proof. Please if you would be able to use the funds for the
Charity works kindly let me know immediately.I will appreciate your utmost
confidentiality and trust in this matter to accomplish my heart desire, as
I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last wish. I want you to take
40 percent of the total money for your personal use while 60% of the money
will go to charity.I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality and trust
in this matter to accomplish my heart desire, as I don't want anything that
will jeopardize my last wish. Please kindly respond for further details.

Thanks and God bless you,
Mrs Kaya Fontane.

I am Miss. Jeniffer Cole, a US citizen, Am 44 years old. I am one 
of those people that took part in receiving Inheritance funds and 
Lottery funds from European banks even from many lottery 
organizers few years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid 
different fees while in the United States trying to get my funds 
from those banks and lottery organizers but all to no avail. So I 
decided to travel to LONDON, UK with all my compensation 
documents, and I was directed by the IMF Director to contact the 
re conciliator Mr Larry Anthony  who is also an attorney, A 
London citizen and a member of the UNITED NATIONS &amp; IMF 
COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE currently working with IMF in the 
United Kingdom, I contacted him and he explained everything to 
me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake. Mr 
Larry Anthony personally directed me on how to claim my 
Inheritance and Lottery payment.

Right now I have received my compensation funds of $4,000,
000.00(Four million dollars) Moreover Mr Larry Anthony showed me 
the full information of those that are yet to receive their 
Inheritance and Lottery payment and I saw your name as one of the 
beneficiaries, and your email address, that is why I decided to 
email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with 
your funds, they are only making money out of you.

I will personally advise you to contact Mr Larry Anthony, he will 
assist you as he is a very religious man with the fear of God.

Dear Friend,

My names are Mrs Linda Martin Lewis, I am a US citizen, i'm 43 years Old. I reside here in Clearwater Florida. My residential address is as follows, 912 Barry st 55rd Pl, Clearwater, Florida 32608-2112, United States. I'm thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that recently took part in the Compensation in Nigeria and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $90,750USD while in the United States trying to get my funds but all to no avail.

I was directed to meet Attorney Wayne Collins whom I explained everything that has happened to me. He made me to understand that i have been contacting the wrong people, and after i fellowed all his instructions on how i would get my funds and i trust in him after 1 week of working with him i was final paid my lost money of $4,500,000.00 (four million five hundred thousand dollars). 

Moreover, Attorney Wayne Collins showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name and email address as one of the beneficiaries that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people.

I will advise you to contact Attorney Wayne Collins You have to contact him directly on this information below.

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing. The only money I paid after I met the Attorney was just $435 for the delivery charges, please take note of that.

receive the sum of (USD 1,500,000.00), one million, five hundrend
thousand dollars, under the United Nations Compensation Commission,

This payment is organised for charity organization and the scam
victims due to complain from the citizens of the United States, as

transfers are handled by Africans, which has made it impossible for a
lot of people to claim their winning prizes or inheritance funds from
most African countries.

you to the paying bank for the above mentioned amount to be
transferred to you through normal procedure. I will also send to you

780, josepedroperezllorca01@gmail.com,Good Business Proposal,"



-- 
My name is Barr. Jose Pedro Perez-Llorca , a legal practitioner in 
Madrid Spain. I have a business proposal which i believe that will be a 
very good opportunity for both of us so I decided to contact you on this 
business opportunity here in Spain.

The proposal is that I have a client, who was deceased since 2000, 
alongside with his entire family in Air France,you can confirm it 
yourself via the website below from BBC NEWS: click on the link for more 
information or confirmation ( 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/859479.stm ). I am contacting you to 
know if you could help or assist me in claiming of the funds that was 
left in my deceased client's bank account in Spain. So, I have decided 
to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as 
the next of kin to the deceased since nobody is coming for it and I 
donâ€™t want this money to go into the banks treasury as unclaimed funds 
or declared to the Government of Spain, once this is done the Government 
of Spain will confiscate the funds, which is not good for both of us. I 
agreed that 40 % of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in 
respect to your acceptance to do this business with me, while 60% would 
be for me and my family. The total amount of cash in the bank account of 
my deceased client is â‚¬24,700,000 (Twenty Four Million, Seven Hundred 
Thousand Euros Only).

The bank have issued to me a notification to contact the next of kin of 
my deceased client for either to re-activate the bank account or to make 
claim of beneficiary of the Money in the bank account, with a month 
surcharge of 6% to be deducted as an Escrow safe keeping fee of the bank 
account, so as to avoid the indefinite closure of the bank account. I 
want to seek your consent first and to present your kind self as the 
next of kin and beneficiary of my deceased client, since I have the 
whole informationâ€™s that the bank will request for the release of the 
fund.
This means that the proceeds of his bank account would be paid to you as 
his next of kin or the legitimate beneficiary. When the money is been 
transferred into your account, I will visit your country to set up an 
investment under your kind control. All the legal documents to back up 
your claim as my client's next of kin would be provided by me. The most 
important thing I want is your honest co-operation in this proposition. 
This would be done under a legitimate arrangement that would protect you 
from any breach of the law.

If this business proposition offends your moral and ethical values, feel 
free to back out. Please contact me at once if you are interested.


Regards,

Barr. Jose Pedro Perez-Llorca

786, mrgedoennet@gmail.com,RE:REPLY MAIL,"

Dear Friend,

It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a surprise. This is because we have not met before but I am inspired to send you this email of this huge fund transfer opportunity that will be of mutual benefit to both of us.

Firstly, let me start by introducing myself properly. I am Gedeon Houssou, credit officer; TRUST FINANCIAL COMPANY here in Cotonou. I hope you will not betray this trust I want to have in you.

One Late Libyian, An Iron Steel Company Chairman with the Federal Government here in Benin until his death some years ago in an Auto Crash Deposited with us some amount of money amounting $14,000,000 (Fourteen million United States Dollars), the company now expects a next of kin as beneficiary of this deposit. Valuable efforts have been made by TRUST FINANCIAL COMPANY to get in touch with any of the late beneficiary family or relatives but to no avail.

Because of the perceived possibilities of not going to be able to locate any of the Late beneficiary next of kin, the management under the leadership of our chairman and members of the board of directors have made arrangements to declare the fund not claimable and therefore be used to import ammunition's into our country.

However, in order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted colleagues and I now seek the consent and involvement of a trusted person who we can present as next of kin to the Late beneficiary so that the fund (US$14,000,000)  will be released and transferred into the persons account as the beneficiary.

All documents and proofs to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out. We have secured from the probate, an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries, and more so, we are assuring you that this business is 100% risk free involvement. Your share remains while the rest will be shared amongst myself and my colleagues for investment purposes anywhere according to agreement between us and yourself.

So, as soon as we receive an acknowledgment of the receipt of this our mutual business proposal from you, we would furnish you with the necessary disbursement ratio to suite both parties. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not hesitate to contact me through my private e-mail : mrgedoennet@gmail.com

Looking forward to your urgent response.

Best regards,
 Gedeon.

NOTIFICATION OF PAYMENT VIA ATM CARD
UNITED NATIONS FUND TRANSFER
ZENITH BANK COMPENSATION UNIT, IN AFFILIATION WITH THE UNITED 
NATIONS.
PAYMENT NOTIFICATION OF YOUR FUND.

Please read this mail carefully and proceed to collect your ATM 
CARD worth US$4.500,000.00 payment.
Following the last year review of the global financial matters 
and just concluded investigations today by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation in conjunction with the ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL 
CRIME COMMISSION (E.F.C.C), it is revealed that your email is 
among the list of people who have never received any of their 
payments among lottery, inheritance, compensation and awarded 
contract funds and victims who have lost a lot of money to 
scammers while trying to claim their funds.

In view of the foregoing, a new payment of US$4.500,000.00 has 
been approved in your favor and credited into an ATM CARD which 
shall be delivered to you.
Note: Thousands of fraudsters have been using this method in 
scamming most foreigner creditors that we have in the payment 
list here in our office. We use this medium to inform you that 
any mail that does not come with the new communication code: 
NG/.CCUF -HFCR-/RLPHJ/.is false. In this case, youâ€™re advised not 
to respond to any mail that does not come with the above 
communication code for safety purpose.

Our final conclusion was that the fund should be paid to you via 
an automated teller machine card (ATM) as it seems, this will be 
easier and faster for you to receive payment.
Your new communication code: NG/.CCUF -HFCR-/RLPHJ/.Do complete 
the below details for proper verification and documentation also 
Reconfirm the followings.

1. Full Names:
2. Residence address:
3. Telephone/Fax number:

Hello,

After a serious thought, i decided to reach you directly and personally
because i do not have anything against you, but your Nigerian partners. I
am a Director in charge of Wire Transfer/Telex Section at the central bank
of Nigeria, Sometime in the past your Nigerian partners approached me
through a friend of mine who works with one of the ministries here and
requested that i assist them conclude a money transfer deal, they told me
to help program the transfer to you.

According to them, they wanted to use this strategy to transfer a huge
Amount of United States dollars fifteen million dollars($15M), the money
has been floating in the CBN suspense account since then. we agreed that
once i do this, they would give me $USD100,000.00 and give me another
$USD100,000.00 when i release the fund to your account. When they saw that
i have programmed it and your name has been approved among the list of
those to be paid, instead of giving me the agreed deposit of
us$100,000.00, they started avoiding me and resorted to threats. I
immediately deleted the transfer code of the fund, which is only known to
me because of my position, and released other contractorsâ€™ fund and
inheritance payments without yours. They became angry.  When they saw that
their threat did not work, they started bribing other officials to get
another approval to transfer the money to you without success. i want you
to know that i am 100% responsible for the delay and obstructions because
of their breach of trust.

If you doubt what i have just told you, then consider what has transpired
through out your claim process, they continue to ask you to pay money
after money and at the end no result and they still tell you to pay
another fee without any result yet, they are simply wicked. Now if you
want us to work together, these are my conditions.

1. I will have 20% of the money because it is only the two of us left for
now.


2. You will assist my son to open an account in your country where i will
pay in my own share.


3. It will be useless and mere waste of time and money if you continue
with any other person, so we will conclude this transaction with utmost
secrecy.

4. You will provide me with your private telephone, mobile and a private
email to facilitate easy communication between you and I only. If these
conditions are acceptable to you, contact me as soon as possible to let us
finalize, so that the funds can be released to your account after due
protocols has been observed. But if you are not interested, i advice you
to forget the fund and stop wasting your time with your so called partners
in paying endless fees.

797, ruphina123-bruce@yahoo.com,HELLO MY DEAR;:   ,"

Dear Sir/Ma,

My name is Mrs. Ruphina Bruce, I am 89 years old widow living in Malta island close to Italy, I am the Mother of late Mr. James Bruce my only son who was a minister of Aviation in my country Malta. My son James and his wife died 5 years ago in Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that crashed on the 8th of March 2014,please you can visit this link
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370 ) for more details of the plane crash that killed my son and his wife.My son James and his wife left behind their only 9 years old daughter whose name is Melina. Melina is my only grandchild and the only heir of my late son Mr. James Bruce.

My son James was not a billionaire but the little he left for his only daughter Melina before he passed on if it is well managed by a good business man or woman in the foreign land; I think my granddaughterâ€™s future will be secured.

My dear, my utmost reason of writing you is because I need your urgent assistance, I want to send my granddaughter (Melina) to you so that she can live with you in your country, this is a very hard decision for me but my condition has forced me to do this which i must do urgently because the doctor said i have little time to live due to the Cancer disease i am currently battling with, my granddaughter (Melina) is very young but rich and lonely,i am the only family she's got ever since she lost her parents, but now i am very old and weak and if anything happens to me she does not know what to do or where to go, this is why i am asking you if you can adopt her and take care of her like your own child.

please do not worry about the cost of securing Melinaâ€™s traveling document and her welfare because Melina is Rich, Melinaâ€™s father had deposited the sum of $21 million usd in Universal bank for Melina and instructed me to handle the online login to the account to Melina when she turns 18, But since i do not have much time to live due to old age and my poor health condition i therefore seek your assistance and honesty to help me adopt melina to take good care of her and handle the funds for her.

With the online account login details which i will hand over to you will enable you transfer the fund from the account to any other bank account of your choice,Please I want you to use part of this money for Melina upbring and her education, then invest the other part in a good business and most importantly, I want you to take good care of Melina, give her all the support and love she needs.

My dear, I am writing you because I am very old and weak now, I canâ€™t walk or even see clearly, what you are reading now was writing by my house help â€œJonnyâ€ with my instruction, so please do not get me wrong because I canâ€™t even see the letters on the computer keyboard let alone type a word. I do not speak English, I speak Maltese so everything here is translated

As soon as I hear a positive response from you, I will release the online bank account details to you to enable you withdraw the required fund to arrange for my granddaughters trip to meet you in your country. .

Thanks

My greetings to you and your family
Mrs. Ruphina Bruce.

802, iibrahimmustafa647@gmail.com,IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE EFCC,"

Sometimes, I do wonder if you are really, really with your 
senses. How Could you keep trusting people and at the end you 
will loose your hard Earned money, or are you being deceived by 
their big names? They Impersonate on many offices, claiming to be 
Governors, Directors/Chairmen of one Office or the other. Their 
game plan is only just to extort your hard Earned money. Now, the 
question is how long you will continue to be Deceived? Sometimes, 
they will issue you fake check, introduce you to fake Diplomatic 
delivery, un-existing on-line banking and they will also fake 
wire transfer of Your fund with Payment Stop Order and even send 
you fake Atm cards etc.

Anyway, by the virtue of my position I have been following this 
Transaction from inception and all your efforts towards realizing 
the Fund. More often than not, I sit down and laugh at your 
ignorance and That of those who claim they are assisting you, it 
is very unfortunate That at the end you loose. Although, I don't 
blame you because you are Not here in Nigeria to witness the 
processing of your payment in Nigeria. The problem you are having 
is that you been told the whole truth About this transaction and 
it is because of this truth they decided to Be extorting your 
money. The most annoying part is even fraudsters Have really 
taken advantage of this opportunity to enrich them selves At your 
expense. Those you feel are assisting or working for you are Your 
main problems. I know the truth surrounding this payment and I am 
The only person who will deliver you from this long suffering if 
you will abide by my advice.

They claim that they are helping you and you forward all the 
fraudulent e-mails you receive to them. At the end they do 
nothing about the fraudsters. Soon they will ask you to pay money 
to receive a compensation of millions of dollars Do not pay any 
money to them because they are only interested in your hard 
earned money and you will never receive any compensation in 
return, they will always keep coming back to ask for more money.

Please I beseech you to stop pursuit of shadows and being 
Deceived. Feel free to contact me immediately you receive this 
mail so that I can Explain to you the modus-operandi guiding the 
release of your Payment. Do not panic, be rest assured that this 
arrangement will be Guided by your Embassy here in Nigeria.

information

Dear Friend,

It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a surprise. This  
is because we have not met before but I am inspired to send you this  
email of this huge fund transfer opportunity that will be of mutual  
benefit to both of us.

Firstly, let me start by introducing myself properly. I am Gedeon  
Houssou, credit officer; TRUST FINANCIAL COMPANY here in Cotonou. I  
hope you will not betray this trust I want to have in you.

One Late Libyian, An Iron Steel Company Chairman with the Federal  
Government here in Benin until his death some years ago in an Auto  
Crash Deposited with us some amount of money amounting $14,000,000  
(Fourteen million United States Dollars), the company now expects a  
next of kin as beneficiary of this deposit. Valuable efforts have been  
made by TRUST FINANCIAL COMPANY to get in touch with any of the late  
beneficiary family or relatives but to no avail.

Because of the perceived possibilities of not going to be able to  
locate any of the Late beneficiary next of kin, the management under  
the leadership of our chairman and members of the board of directors  
have made arrangements to declare the fund not claimable and therefore  
be used to import ammunition's into our country.

However, in order to avert this negative development, some of my  
trusted colleagues and I now seek the consent and involvement of a  
trusted person who we can present as next of kin to the Late  
beneficiary so that the fund (US$14,000,000)  will be released and  
transferred into the persons account as the beneficiary.

All documents and proofs to enable you get this fund have been  
carefully worked out. We have secured from the probate, an order of  
mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries, and more so, we  
are assuring you that this business is 100% risk free involvement.  
Your share remains while the rest will be shared amongst myself and my  
colleagues for investment purposes anywhere according to agreement  
between us and yourself.

So, as soon as we receive an acknowledgment of the receipt of this our  
mutual business proposal from you, we would furnish you with the  
necessary disbursement ratio to suite both parties. If this proposal  
is acceptable by you, do not hesitate to contact me through my private  
e-mail : rc229net@gmail.com

Looking forward to your urgent response.

Best regards,
  Gedeon.

I am Nicolas Pura Conzalez the Principle Attorney of a renowned law and 
auditing firm here in Spain. I was contracted to audit the accounting 
section of some firms in Spain. This audit in line with government 
policies and account reconciliation became necessary following the 
current European Economic crisis which Spain happens to be one of the 
most pretentious countries with the Euro Zone.

During my audits, I discovered several dormant accounts due to 
inactivity. some of the said account has been dormant for over a decade 
as the initial owner of funds are demised. Against this
backdrop, I decided to contact you in order to confirm whether or not 
you know or are related to the deceased family? This is because from our 
preliminary findings, your and one of the deceased happen to bear same 
surname and common heritage.

Lastly, owing to the sensitivity of this situation, I urge you to keep 
this proposal in utmost confidentiality pending our discussion. I expect 
your response to enable me send you more informations.Plese direct your

<p>Dear Sir,
 I decided to write you this proposal in good faith, believing that you will not betray me.My name is Mr Ronnie Russell, a senior manager of Hawes bank Plc, New Jersey, USA. I got your information during my search on your Country Chambers of Commerce. I am 46 Years of Age and Married with two Lovely Kids.It may interest you to hear that I am a man of peace and I only hope we can assist each other. I am looking for a Reliable individual resident in India that understands English language 
and Indian local language, to handle a profitable business for our mutual benefit,  A citizen of your country and Gold dealer made a fixed deposit with my bank in January 2009 for 36 calendar months, valued at (US$8,700,000) Eight Million, Seven Hundred Thousand US Dollars. The due date for this deposit contract was the 2nd of April 2012.Sadly Mr.Sanjay was among the death victims while on a business trip to Indonesia in September 2009 earth quake. He met his untimely death in the 
Indonesian 2009 September earth quake.
  My bank management is yet to know about his death, I knew about it because he was my friend and I was his Account Officer. Mr. Sanjay did not mention any Next of Kin/ Heir when the account was opened, he was not married and no children. Last week my Bank Management requested that (Mr. Sanjay) should give instructions on what to do about his funds, if to renew the contract. I know this will happen and that is why I have been looking for a means to handle the situation, because if my Bank 
Directors happens to know that Mr. Sanjay is dead and do not have any Heir, they will take the funds for their personal use, so I don't want such to happen.  That is why I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the Next of Kin/ Heir to the account, since you area foreigner and my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.There is no risk involved; the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect us from any breach of law. It is better that we 
claim the money, than allowing the Bank Directors to take it, they are rich already.  I am not a greedy person, so I am suggesting we share the funds in this ratio, 50/50% .Let me know your mind on this and please do treat this information highly confidential.We shall go over the details once I receive your Urgent response. You can contact me on my private email address (<a href=""mailto:rronnie759@gmail.com"">rronnie759@gmail.com</a>)for details.</p>

I am Miss. Jeniffer Cole, a US citizen, Am 44 years old. I am one 
of those people that took part in receiving Inheritance funds and 
Lottery funds from European banks even from many lottery 
organizers few years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid 
different fees while in the United States trying to get my funds 
from those banks and lottery organizers but all to no avail. So I 
decided to travel to LONDON, UK with all my compensation 
documents, and I was directed by the IMF Director to contact the 
re conciliator Mr Larry Anthony  who is also an attorney, A 
London citizen and a member of the UNITED NATIONS &amp; IMF 
COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE currently working with IMF in the 
United Kingdom, I contacted him and he explained everything to 
me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake. Mr 
Larry Anthony personally directed me on how to claim my 
Inheritance and Lottery payment.

Right now I have received my compensation funds of $4,000,
000.00(Four million dollars) Moreover Mr Larry Anthony showed me 
the full information of those that are yet to receive their 
Inheritance and Lottery payment and I saw your name as one of the 
beneficiaries, and your email address, that is why I decided to 
email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with 
your funds, they are only making money out of you.

I will personally advise you to contact Mr Larry Anthony, he will 
assist you as he is a very religious man with the fear of God.

Compensation Award Office.

Name: Mr Larry Anthony

Email: LarryAnthony700@gmail.com

Listed below are the name of fraudsters and banks behind the non 
release of your funds that I managed to sneak out for your kind 
perusal.

2) Ms. Carman L. Lapointe
3) Mrs. Sherry Williams
4) Mr. Dan Rochas (I.M.F)
5) Mrs. Tanner Williams
6 Mr.Ibrahim Lamorde
7) Mr Thomas Jayce
8) Mr Rodney Cole

11) WESTERN UNION
12) Mr Dickson Walker
13) Mr Darrell Whigham
14) Mr Stephany adams
15) Fake bank of america
16) George Anthony

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are 
contacting you and telling you that your funds is with them, it 
is not in anyway with them and they are only taking advantage of 
you which means they will dry you up until you have nothing. The 
only money I paid after I met Mr Robert Sanchez was $425 take 
note of that.

NOTE: THE ONLY MONEY YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY AND WHICH I ALSO PAID 
IS $425 AS IMPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT ON YOUR PACKAGE.

Once again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to 
contact Mr Robert Sanchez instead of wasting your time and money 
with those liars that will be turning you around asking for 
different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank You and Remain Blessed.

Sorry to have invaded your privacy; I am Alexander John Howard account officer in PNC Bank. I have a business proposal for you and I need your sincerity and dedication to go along with. A contractor made a deposit for 12 Years valued at US$27,000,000.00 (Twenty Seven Million United States Dollars Only).

As my job demand, I sent a routine notification to his forwarded address but got no reply. After a month, we discovered from his closest associate, that the depositor had died. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a (WILL). And behold the money (THE DEPOSIT) is still there in my bank without anybody coming to claim beneficiary.

However, my proposal to you is that I want to front you as the (RIGHTFUL BENEFICIARY to the fund i.e the Next of kin). If this transaction interest you, kindly let me know so I can advice you on how we are going to execute this deal successfully. Above all, indicate your interest by sending me an email. to my private e-mail address: johnhoward839@mail.ee

Good Day,
My name is Mrs. Irene Shawcross; I am a dying woman who had decided to
donate what I have to the Charities based on the instructions given to 
me by my late husband Mr. Shaw. I am 70 years old and was diagnosed with 
cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death of my husband 
who was Marine engineer and a contractor from governmental tenders and 
other private entities, my late husband died accidentally under one of 
the heavy duty equipment at one of his construction sites, We had not a 
single child of our own to count on, We have been touched to donate from 
what I have inherited from my late husband for the good work rather than 
allow his relatives to varnish my husband's hard earned fund, although 
they have already looted and taken a lot. My health will not permit me 
to carry out some of the things, each day that passes by, I am afraid to 
die, but life gives me no choice, but to answer the call.

I managed to get your contact details online in my desperate search for 
a trustworthy person to assist me in this transaction, and he or she  
will also benefit financially. Recently, the doctors told me I might not 
live longer than 3 months after they diagnosed me of chronic/acute 
lymphoma or myelitis [leukemia]. Leukemia is a blood cancer in both the 
bone marrow and in blood itself, leukemia cells crowd out normal blood 
cells leading to serious bleeding and infection. I have been undergoing 
blood transfusion and it has drained My purse and little savings in my 
hand although I belong to the high and rich, but feed like a person who 
has nothing, as a result of this sickness. I want you to help me in 
carrying out my last wish on earth which will be very profitable to us. 
I want to WILL/Donate to you the total sum of $30.5 million USDollars 
(Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) to you which I want 
you to distribute part of it to any charity home for me in your country 
and the rest for yourself and your family which I will inform you on how 
to share all as part of instructions from my late husband before his 
death; You will get 20% of the fund as your compensation for helping me 
and my late husband to fulfill the project.
please for further information contact me ASAP. Please reply as quickly 
as you can, based on the fact that this is very urgent. You can also 
call me if you can, although I am in and out the hospital for treatment, 
but once the hospital gives me chance to use my phone I will answer your 
call.

Unpaid Beneficairy,

I am Ms Alice Hall a US citizen, Am 45 years old. I am one of 
those people that took part in receiving Inheritance funds and 
Lottery funds from European banks even from many lottery 
organizers few years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid 
different fees while in the United States trying to get my funds 
from those banks and lottery organizers but all to no avail. So I 
decided to travel to Nigeria with all my compensation documents, 
and I was directed by the IMF Director to contact the 
reconciliatory Barr. Khalid Spoon who is an attorney, A British 
citizen and a member of the UNITED NATIONS &amp; IMF COMPENSATION 
AWARD COMMITTEE currently working with IMF in the Nigeria and I 
contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever 
is contacting us through emails are fake. Barr. Khalid Spoon 
personally directed me on how to claim my Inheritance or Lottery 
payment.

Right now I have received my compensation funds of $9,500,000.00 
Moreover, Barr. Khalid Spoon as he is a very religious man with 
the fear of God. He showed me the full information of those that 
are yet to receive their Inheritance or Lottery payment and I saw 
your name as one of the beneficiaries, and your email address,
that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those 
people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money 
out of you.

I will personally advise you to contact Barr. Khalid Spoon, he 
will assist you.

Compensation Award Office.

Name: Barr. Khalid Spoon

Email Address: khalidSpoon@protonmail.com


Listed below are the name of fraudsters and banks behind the non 
release of your funds that I managed to sneak out for your kind 
perusal.

 1) Mr. James B. Comey Jr.
 2) Robert S. Mueller, III.
 3) Mr Ban Ki-moon.
 4) Ms. Carman L. Lapointe.

 8) Dr Godwin Emefiele.

 10) Mr Danny Blessed.

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are 
contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is 
not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you 
and they will dry you up until you have nothing. The only money I 
paid after I met Barr. Khalid Spoon was just $400usd for the 
Endorsement Fee, take note of that.

Dear,

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.
I will introduce myself as Head of Foreign Operations of a well-known
bank here in the United Kingdom.

One of our accounts with holding balance of Â£15,000,000(Fifteen
Million British pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for
the past 4 years.

From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account a
foreigner by name Gerald Stone died in 4th of January 2012 and since
then nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money
because he has no family members who are aware of the existence of
neither the account nor the funds.

Also Information from the National Immigration states that he was also
single on entry into the UK.

I have secretly discussed this matter with some of the bank officials
and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with.

We thus propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of
kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after
due processes have been
followed.

This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is a
legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism
or any other illegal act.
On your interest, let me hear from you.

Mr James Cutter"

 read carefully to confirm every history about the death of Mr. John Shumej=
da.
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1742404.stm
 My name is Mr. Ronald Evergreen, i work with a well known financial house =
(BANK) here in London and I am the personal account officer to late Mr. Joh=
n Shumejda who died in a plane crash in the year 2002 when a private jet cr=
ashed during take-off from Birmingham Airport. I had a private meeting with=
 My late client same day before the crash and this gentleman had a plans of=
 investing over GBP =A310 Million Great British Pounds sterling into some v=
enture in Dubai and make me the manager of that venture upon my retirement =
in some months time. Mr. John Shumejda is a very close friend and big clien=
t, we believes so much in me and what i advise him. I was shocked and i alm=
ost died when i head of his sudden death after some hours both of us spoke =
together.
 A few months ago I received a MEMO from my bank as his personal account of=
ficer were i was told that since the death of Mr. John Shumejda in 2002, no=
 one has ever come forth as his next of kin to make inquiry of his deposit =
with the Bank, therefore, i have been mandated to search for his next of ki=
n and present to the bank between now and end of this month otherwise his d=
eposited funds will be cancelled and send to the UK Government Treasury Acc=
ount for confiscation. And all effort to locate any of his family member ha=
s proven unfruitful and as far as i know, Mr. Shumejda has no next of kin b=
ecause he has no children and his wife also died a few years after the deat=
h of his husband because she could not bear the pains.
 Therefore, i am contacting you to stand as my foreign partner to claim as =
next of kin to late Mr. John Shumejda so that the bank can release his depo=
sited amounting to the sum of GBP =A355,78 Million Great British Pounds ste=
rling in your favor. And once the money is released into your bank account,=
 we will share the total sum via the following ratio 45% for you as my trus=

The time given to me by the bank is almost up and i can not let them confis=

he rest will be shared among the board of directors of the bank. I believe =
that this is my chance and a great opportunity to make the most of what lif=

Hi,

I apologise for my late response, it's because of the issue i told you
i have with my husband, he seized my laptop, i just retrieved it to
send this email, my replies might be slow sometimes because i hide to
send you emails because he monitors me always, i saw the documents you
sent but the 3rd file did not download, are you giving me assurance
that once i send the $8,850 dollars, the compensation ATM card will be
delivered to me at the hospital address i gave you in Kenya? and i can
be withdrawing from ATM's with it? can i transfer money from the ATM
to bank accounts? can i use the ATM card on POS machines and online
stores? the agent has to wait for me at the hospital gate and text me
that he is their so i can meet him there, i don't want him calling my
phone or coming inside the hospital premises as i won't want my
husband to see him, i hope there won't be any issue when i try to
withdraw from ATM's? like i told you earlier, i'm a Singaporean
married to a Kenyan, we have a private hospital in Kenya and another
hospital in Singapore, so i travel to Singapore often, if i travel to
Singapore can i use the ATM in Singapore? the limit i can transfer
from western union or moneygram is $2000 dollars, so send 3 additional
names so i can split the money when sending.

If i send the money tomorrow can the delivery man depart Nigeria for
Kenya the following day with the compensation fund ATM card? answer my
questions and give me assurance, once you give me assurance and send
more names i will pay the fee tomorrow.

Awaiting your response,

Mrs Stacey"
850, mr.davidmoyes881@yahoo.com,Re:Attention Dear Owner...190.104.150.38,"

Attention,

I am Mr. David Moyes, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 130kg.


The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.
By my assessment, each of the boxes contains $4M  which is total of $8Million USD. They are  still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two  metal trunk boxes weighing about 65kg each (Internal dimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name and email on the official document from United Nations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, full address so I  can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK. (place of origin) as we were instructed.

(Reply to this email : ( mr.davidmoyes881@yahoo.com  )

As I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages provided you will also give me something  out of it (financial gratification). You can either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the  necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the  destination of your choice. I need all the guarantee that I can get from  you before I can get involved in this project.

Dear Friend,

Please permit me to introduce myself. My name is Pedro Lamas. I earn a 
living in the oil industry as an independent Feasibility/Project 
Management Consultant to oil refineries and other oil industries in 
Southern African, East Africa and some parts of Asia. We are based in 
Johannesburg RSA. Our mandate includes identifying specific licensed 
crude oil export/ marketing firms and recommending these firms to the 
oil refineries for supply of crude oil to the refineries.

On my desk is a mandate from one the refineries to arrange for crude 
oil purchase from Libya for up to 2,000,000 barrels on monthly bases 
for 12 calendar months. 

The essence of my reaching out to you is the fact that am in the 
process of building a middle man structure to mediate between the 2 
parties involved before the contract is signed. You may be wondering 
why I cannot do it by myself right? The honest fact is that as a 
consultant to these oil refineries, we are not allowed to act as 
suppliers of crude oil to them as well, hence the reason I need a 
trustworthy person outside my work circle in order to maintain a 
discreet profile. 

I wish to extend this partnership to you my friend to build a middle 
man structure with you, while I work from the back to guide you. Our 
commission/brokerage as middle persons is between $2 - $3 per barrel 
as 
case may be. So if the target of 2M barrels is met monthly we stand to 
share $4M - $6M every month for a span of 12 months with possible 
extension. 

Worry less about the speedy sales as I have contacts within oil 
producing country's top officials for license of crude oil 
export/lifting to any firm I so present for this business. Therefore 
if 
you can be able to handle this transaction with honesty and integrity, 
you should come back to me immediately for more details. Your urgent 
response is highly needed and you can reach me on the following email 
address: pedrolamas22@jmail.co.za

Dear Beneficiary,



Series of meetings have been held over the past 7 months with the secretary general of the United Nations Organization. This ended 3 days ago. It is obvious that you have not received your fund which is to the tune of Eight Million and Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars ($8,500,000.00) due to past corrupt Governmental Officials who almost held the fund to themselves for their selfish reason and some individuals who have taken advantage of your fund all in an attempt to swindle your fund which has led to so many losses from your end and unnecessary delay in the receipt of your fund.



The National Central Bureau of Interpol enhanced by the United Nations and Federal Bureau of Investigation have successfully passed a mandate to the current president of United States Of America his Excellency President Donald J. Trump to boost the exercise of clearing all foreign debts owed to you and other individuals and organizations who have been found not to have receive their Contract Sum, Lottery/Gambling, Inheritance and the likes. Now how would you like to receive your payment? Because we have two method of payment which is by Check or by ATM card?



ATM Card: We will be issuing you a custom pin based ATM card which you will use to withdraw up to $3,000 per day from any ATM machine that has the Master Card Logo on it and the card have to be renewed in 4 years time which is 2020. Also with the ATM card you will be able to transfer your funds to your local bank account. The ATM card comes with a handbook or manual to enlighten you about how to use it. Even if you do not have a bank account.



Check: To be deposited in your bank for it to be cleared within three working days. Your payment would be sent to you via any of your preferred option and would be mailed to you via DHL. Because we have signed a contract with DHL which should expire in next three weeks you will only need to pay $310 instead of $600 saving you $290. So if you pay before the three weeks you save $290 Take note that anyone asking you for some kind of money above the usual fee is definitely a fraudsters and you will have to stop communication with every other person if you have been in contact with any.


DO NOT SEND MONEY TO ANYONE UNTIL YOU READ THIS: The actual fees for shipping your ATM card is $600 but because DHL have temporarily discontinued the C.O.D which gives you the chance to pay when package is delivered for international shipping We had to sign contract with them for bulk shipping which makes the fees reduce from the actual fee of $600 to $310 nothing more and no hidden fees of any sort!Note: Everything has been taken care of by the Federal Government, The United Nation and also the FBI and including taxes, custom paper and clearance duty so all you will ever need to pay is $310.



To effect the release of your fund valued at $8,500,000.00 you are advised to contact our correspondent, the delivery officer Bar Lord Ruben with the information below,
NAME:  Bar Lord Ruben

United Kingdom, I contacted him and he explained everything to
